The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent \\'prayer of the bone\" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don\\'t get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It\\'s just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.  Lets hope this show continues on for many years to come.']"

              "'the question is \"did we really need to rebuild her?\" after watch all eight episodes of this bionic woman remake, i say no!this last tv season nbc choose to remake the bionic woman for the 2000\\'s. in trying to gain success like sci-fi channel had the other 1970\\'s remake  battlestar galactica, the producers took a gritter style...and it failed on many levels.as lovely as michelle ryan is, she is no lindsay wagner. ms ryan tries to give this piece heart. the character , a bartender , is given her bionics after an auto accident with her government surgeon boyfriend.  she is saddled her with a felony kid sister (lucy hale) who was dumped on her when their father disappeared. ryan is one of the reason\\'s to watch this show.however, the heart of the show is buried deep within sub plots of the previous sort of evilish bionic woman sarah (katee sackhoff from the remake of gallatica) and ideas of double crossing people that seemed to be ripped off from old alias plots. this new woman is told is a soap opera form, which weaken this piece.the highlight of the show after ryan  is miguel ferrer as the mysterious  jonas. he plays a tough as nails agency boss, better than richard anderson ever played oscar goldman. his stone cold demeanor works well in this character, better than he did in crossing jordan (which season one is coming on dvd soon)the funnest thing about this new bionic woman. she  has  <PRICE>  dollars worth of bionics parts, up from the 1970\\'s amount of six million..inflation, inflation, inflation!i am sadden that only eight episodes (which are all presented here) were made of this series before the writer\\'s strike of tv season 2007-2008. it had promise, but we may never know if it could have developed. nbc network  has not stated if this show has been renewed for the next season. so these eight episodes may be the only  episodes of this seriesi can only wish that someone would release the classic six million dollar man or the original bionic woman on dvd...now that was great television!bennet pomerantz audioworld'"

The tutorial runs like an interactive video, meaning the instructions move along at a set (slow) pace and the pace is paused while the game waits for you to do an action.Then in regular gameplay, if I make a shape on a lower level, it doesn&rsquo;t stick together when I try to move it up. There should be a default state that keeps blocks stuck together (if they are the same color) but still lets you pull them apart when you need to, like making a Lego shape. I wasn&rsquo;t able to make a complete row in the upper section, because I was moving fast, trying to keep the lower section from filling up. Then, the game ended when the blocks in the upper section reached a seemingly arbitrary level.Another problem is unprofessional design. I appreciate the general look intended, but the graphics are of a low resolution and the choice of color scheme seems to be without a clear purpose; is it supposed to be a retro, &rsquo;80s 16-color look? These colors suggest here additive color-mixing, but that&rsquo;s not a component of the game.

              "'(Full disclosure: I received a free electronic copy of this book for review through Library Thing&#8217;s Member Giveaway program. Also, vague spoilers in the last few paragraphs.)Nineteen-year-old Jet Tetsuo is a skag. Along with thousands of other human refugees, Jet spends most of her time underground, eking out the barest existence beneath the ruins of what once was Vancouver. It&#8217;s this, or risk capture by the Nirreth: a race of blue, bipedal, lizard-like aliens that invaded Earth several generations before. Rumor has it that the Nirreth vivisect humans, keep them as slaves, and even cook and eat them. To be picked up by a Nirreth culling ship means certain death. Or at least that&#8217;s the word in the skag pits that Jet calls home.A fierce fighter who&#8217;s skilled with the blade, Jet saves most of her worries for her younger brother, Biggs, who&#8217;s been spending a dangerous amount of time hanging around the rebel fighters. It&#8217;s him she&#8217;s thinking of when, out on a trading errand overworld, she&#8217;s spotted and captured by a Nirreth culling ship. In time, she learns that she&#8217;s a &#8220;special commission&#8221;: the ship&#8217;s captain, Eamon Richter, former leader of the resistance in Vancouver, abducted Jet for sale to the Nirreth High Command for the Pacific Region &#8211; &#8220;The Royals&#8221; for short. Like many humans kidnapped to the Green Zones (park-like cities constructed by the Nirreth), Jet is to be a pet for her Nirreth owner&#8217;s amusement. In addition to providing protection to Ogli, the young heir to the throne, Jet is slated to fight in the Rings for the amusement of Nirreth crowds. But only if she can pass the demonstration.The first installment in THE SLAVE CHRONICLES, THE CULLING is an enjoyable and fast-paced read. It&#8217;s got everything a YA (NA?) scifi fan could want: A kick-ass heroine. Sword play. Space ships and intergalactic travel. Environmental collapse. A burgeoning rebellion. Alien colonizers. Dinosaurs, even!Especially captivating are the Nirreth and their artificial cities. I don&#8217;t know whether JC Andrijeski is a fan of Octavia Butler or not, but the Nirreth share many similarities with the Oankali from LILITH&#8217;S BROOD. In both cases, the aliens visited Earth only when it was on the brink of environmental ruin (or just after, in the Oankali&#8217;s case). Whereas the Nirreth colonized Earth and kept humans as pets, the Oankali rescued the human survivors of a global nuclear war, keeping them alive and in stasis on their ships while they repaired Earth &#8211; all with the eventual goal of settling Earth and interbreeding with humans. (A &#8220;trading&#8221; species, the Oankali&#8217;s currency is their superior DNA.) Both species of aliens control humans through the use of organic chemicals: Nirreth inject humans with their stingers, while Oankali emit chemicals through their skin. Either way, the result is the same: these substances make humans more pliant and encourage positive feelings towards their captors. Eventually, often without even realizing it, humans come to enjoy their enslavement and non-consensual relationships with the Nirreth/Oankali. Despite these rights violations, the aliens see themselves as &#8220;benign dictators&#8221; &#8211; an advanced species that knows what&#8217;s best for all of humanity.While THE CULLING is happily absent any rape scenes, it&#8217;s heavily implied &#8211; if not outright stated &#8211; that the Nirreth commonly take their human pets as &#8220;lovers.&#8221; Of course, this raises all sorts of issues regarding consent; I&#8217;m curious to see how Andrijeski will handle this in upcoming installments.* spoiler alert! *I was going to give THE CULLING four stars&#8230;until the last few pages. While I saw the first plot twist coming from a mile away (suggesting that it wasn&#8217;t much of a twist at all), the second was more of a shock. Given the ending, I really, really, really hope that the author isn&#8217;t planning a romance between Jet and Anaze. Whether he was correct in thinking that she&#8217;d want to take on this role within the resistance or not, Anaze had no right to recruit Jet without her consent or knowledge. Worse still, she&#8217;s not some random stranger, but his best friend and a would-be partner. You simply cannot profess to love someone &#8211; and then sell her into slavery and enlist her in a war without her permission. It&#8217;s the ultimate betrayal, and whatever happens to Jet while in Nirreth custody ultimately falls at Anaze&#8217;s feet. This might very well include rape. Already she&#8217;s been stripped naked and subjected to a medical exam in front of Richter&#8217;s leering eyes; that&#8217;s a form of sexual assault right there.Anaze set her up, full stop. If things work out the way he planned, perhaps Jet will be able to forgive him some day. But to be more than friends &#8211; or even just passing acquaintances &#8211; requires trust and intimacy, neither of which Anaze has earned. I will throw my Kindle if these two end up together, is what I&#8217;m saying. (Onto a generously padded mattress, but still. I WILL THROW IT AT SOMETHING.)3.5 stars, rounded down to 3 on Amazon. I&#8217;m curious to see how this plays out &#8211; and will probably download the next installment on Amazon &#8211; but also more than a little apprehensive about the pending (maybe?) romance.'"

Cessie is a diabetic and unfortunately Phoebe has no health insurance. Phoebe works as a cleaning lady at Chicago&#8217;s exclusive Players Health Club but this job doesn&#8217;t pay very much. When Phoebe finds an expensive looking Rolex in one of the mobster&#8217;s lockers she decides to take it with her. But soon Phoebe is ridden with guild and tries to find a way to return the watch without anyone finding out.Than Phoebe meets Michael. Michael is charming and handsome and a little dangerous (but let&#8217;s face it, that&#8217;s half the charm). And most of all Michael is nice to Phoebe. But soon Phoebe finds out that Michael isn&#8217;t how he seems to be. But still Phoebe can&#8217;t seem to stay away from him. And unfortunately Phoebe soon finds out that one decision can change everything.Although &#8216;The Find&#8217; didn&#8217;t seem my kind of book at first, I was completely hooked from the first page. This book was exciting and really thrilling and I just really had to know what would happen next. Phoebe is a likeable character and even though she made a big mistake I could really relate to her. Reading this book you can really understand why she made that mistake. All Phoebe wanted was to give her two daughters a better life. And through the book you really learn that Phoebe will do everything for her two girls. At times it was really frustrating to see how that one mistake changed everything and sometimes I just really wished Phoebe would just take her girls and run like hell.What I really liked about this book is that you read what Phoebe is thinking. So every time she does something or makes a decision you read about her thought process. This really made the book interesting. Although I sometimes wanted to scream &#8216;NOOOOOOOO!!!&#8217; you still kind of understand why Phoebe makes her decisions. Not always very smart, but still kind of understandable.I really was pleasantly surprised by &#8216;The Find&#8217;. Last night I just had to find out how this book would end so I read till late at night, just to finish this book. That is definitely something &#8216;The Find&#8217; will make you do. Gregg Bell&#8217;s writing pulls you in and you just have to finish it. I&#8217;m very honored to have received this book for my honest review and I would recommend this book for everyone who loves to get pulled into an exciting book full of suspense.'"

              "\"Blood Stone.  Tracy Cooper-PoseyReview from Jeannie Zelos Book reviews.I've read several of Tracy's novels now &#8211; they all feature some very steamy, sensual scenes. Its some time since I read Blood Knot, the first in this series but it quickly came back when I started this one. We meet Winter, Niall and Sebastian again, along with some new people who have a place in the coming vampire disclosure problems. Reading this book actually clarified some of the problems I had with the first &#8211; I understand Nial's problems and concerns much better after getting into this book. Once again there are some superb sensual love scenes, some great characters, plots and counter plots, danger and secrets all wrapped up in Tracy&#8217;s typical quality writing. Its an involved novel, not a light-hearted quick read, but one where you get fully immersed in another world, and feel as if you're there in it. I did have trouble initially with the fact that Winter et al all had different names as they were working in disguise trying to see who Nial's plots would flush out &#8211; and it brought forward more than they anticipated.I love the way Tracy's people feel so real, that the world she created feels like one I could be involved in, and most of all the way she takes people who don't like each other at all, and yet she takes them on a journey that ends with them being lovers. Once again I could see this happening, and yet can't pinpoint a moment when I saw the change of feelings occur. There's a lot to her characters too -they have problems with their pasts, and the effects that has on their present, there's hidden secrets with all of them &#8211; and some good ones I certainly didn't see coming. It all leads to a fascinating and engrossing read, with spicy, sexy, sensual m&eacute;nage scenes. Take note of that warning if this offends you! For me Tracy does these in a way that's erotic but not cringe-making. Often I&#8217;m reading what should be erotic scenes and they just become really eurghh....I feel embarrassed reading them as they seem so contrived, but never with Tracy though &#8211; her scenes fit the plots and characters perfectly and are well written.I'm keen to get onto book three now :) and find out what else is in store...This book is priced at 3.21 for a huge 424 pages &#8211; I love these longer books, they're my favourite as they have scope for plots and characters to be made very realistic, and at this price this is a bargain.Stars: five, cracking read.ARC supplied via Netgalley\""

              "'Joel Nelson changes the game with his groundbreaking work, &#8216;Stupid or Liar&#8217;&#8212;he opens our eyes to the &#8216;obvious secrets&#8217;, those things that we take for granted everyday yet surprise us for the truth behind them. And Nelson attacks mercilessly and leaves no stone unturned&#8212;from sex to financial investment, this book made my head spin in the same way Carl Sagan&#8217;s &#8216;Dragons of Eden&#8217; did so many years ago.&#8216;Stupid or Liar&#8217; is probably best described as some sort of &#8220;bible&#8221; for living a BS-free, more intelligent life. Armed with his broadsword of an intellect, Nelson slays one monstrous myth after another, and fleshes out for us the bleeding truth. For instance, I have read a number of books in the past that boasts of showing a &#8220;fool-proof trading strategy that eliminates the possibility of losses&#8221;. Now Nelson&#8217;s book tells me such a thing does not exist&#8212;and that&#8217;s only for starters. He goes on&#8212;and in quite an articulate fashion&#8212;to aim his blunderbuss at other important things that matter in our lives: how we spend our money, how we invest and grow it, and how, in many more ways than we can count, we have been fed with lies by those who know how the whole thing works. Hopefully, with this book, with more people finally getting even a glimmer of an understanding how the financial system works, then maybe we can stop America&#8212;and the rest of the world&#8212;from financially haemorrhaging. Maybe&#8212;finally&#8212;we can all learn how to determine if someone is just being stupid or is knowingly selling us snake oil.What&#8217;s more, Nelson writes in a deeply engaging, enthralling manner&#8212;he grabs you attention right at the get-go, and never lets up. The book is actually entertaining even when Nelson is describing technical data&#8212;he brings it all down to a level anyone can easily understand, so that you walk away from reading the book with a solid understanding of what has been discussed&#8212;and then, hopefully, you can make better informed decisions.The bottom line: this book is not so much as about the &#8220;what&#8221; but about the &#8220;how&#8221;: he reminds us how to think better, more rationally, more logically. Yet, the book is brimming with intriguing information that will leave you making a double-take. The book, if anything, teaches is to unshackle ourselves from self-defeating financial ignorance. And as such, &#8216;Stupid or Liar&#8217; is an incredible must-read for so many reasons. Order a copy of this book today&#8212;or better, give it as a gift to all your friends&#8212;who knows, you might be able to change a life. I give it a solid five-star rating.'"

He promises her that there will be no more secrets between them.  They had overcome the attempt on her life and the fact that Vaughn had not told her about Brent hiring him to seduce her to prove immorality.  They were together and working as a team to prevent Brent from selling the business out from under her because there was no way she could ever do without Vaughn.Keely and Vaughn agree to keep their reunited state a secret so that he can continue to investigate without any one the wiser.  It seems like every turn they make and clue they uncover is useless, with time running out.  Brent has called for a vote to sell the company to a shell corporation and it looks like he has secured the votes necessary to ensure a takeover.  Things are really looking bleak and Keely fears she will not be able to save her father&#8217;s company.When she is having lunch with Vaughn a ghost from his past causes a wall to be erected between them. Keely reminds Vaughn that they are not to keep anything from each other, even things from the past.  Will Vaughn be able to open up and share the damage done to his heart by this woman?  Or will he allow it to break the precious connection that is being built between them?  When Vaughn walks away, Keely is deeply concerned that he will not return.Vaughn confesses to Keely that he was engaged at one time to the woman at the restaurant and that she had betrayed him with his brother.  He tells Keely that he now knows the difference between then and now. Keely is it for him, she is the one that he thinks about.  The past is slowly being put behind him and the future is ahead.  Now all he needs is to prove to her that he is the one for her and they can have a future together.The discovery that there was a third partner in the original company pulls out a possible answer for all the things that have been happening.  When Keely and Vaughn do a little undercover snooping, they find out that Martin Ridley is not only the one behind the takeover bid for the company but he was a third partner at one time.  All of this is a play to resume the company and get his revenge.  Is there more to the story?  How can they prove that he is the one behind everything?  Keely&#8217;s attempted murder?  The threats made against Keely&#8217;s mother and Vaughn&#8217;s family was he responsible for those?  Did he have Vaughn&#8217;s dad killed?Hero &#8211;Vaughn: 4.5 starsHeroine &#8211;Keely Fawes: 4.5 starsSteam: 5 starsPlot: 4.5 starsCliffhanger: NoWould I recommend this book: Yes!

              "\"this was the game i first got with my gamecube, and it still remains one of the best fighting video games of all time in my book. it takes everything that was in the first and makes it a thousand times more elaborate.the music was all midi in the first one, now we have some awesome orchestral compositions that are updates of all sorts of classic nintendo themes. my personal favorite themes are: mute city, big blue, fountain of dreams, great bay, the temple, fourside, and venom.the first game only had 12 players (8 at the start and 4 hidden), now there are 25 in all! the original 8 (mario, donkey kong, link, samus aran, yoshi, kirby, fox mccloud and pikachu) are back in the starting lineup, and the previously hidden ness and captain falcon are immediately available as well. 4 new characters join the starters in the form of bowser, peach, zelda (who can transform into her alter ego sheik), and the rather obscure eskimo pair known as the ice climbers. 11 hidden characters are to be found. in addition to the two returning from the original (jigglypuff and luigi), dr. mario is in for a routine physical; falco lombardi of the starfox team flies into town; link goes back seven years in the past as young link, and has a run in with his arch enemy, ganondorf; roy and marth of fire emblem have joined the party; two more pokemon have been caught in the form of mewtwo and pichu (aka baby pikachu); and even nintendo's very first character, a little lcd man known as mr. game and watch, is featured.in the first, there were only 9 arenas, now there are at least 20, and they are far more interactive than they were before. for example: in brinstar depths, every 15 or so seconds, let's say, a giant monster named kraid (metroid fans remember fighting him) comes in and takes a swipe at the arena, moving it around either counter clockwise or clockwise and changing where you can and can't stand.the single player mode has been significantly updated. in addition to the classic single player mode (which has been somewhat reformulated), there are two new modes: adventure and all-star. all-star mode pits you against random assortments of 1, 2 and 3 characters in 12 matches and ends with a battle against 25 mr. game and watch drones. adventure mode, on the other hand, is a series of 12 stages that include side-scrolling action as well as fighting. for example: in stage 3, the underground maze, there are two parts. part 1 is the maze itself, which may end up pitting you against link several times; then, in part 2, you have a fight with zelda at the temple.the classic 1 player mode has been formulated somewhat differently as well. there are no set opponents except for master hand in the final stage. there are three traditional matchups against a random opponent (like the ones in the first one against link, fox, pikachu and samus), one matchup against a random giant opponent with 2 random computer controlled allies (like the giant dk battle in the first one), one 2-on-2 matchup with a random computer-controlled ally (like the mario bros. battle in the first one), a battle against a metal opponent (like the one against metal mario), a battle against a team of 10 of a random character (like the kirby, yoshi and fighting polygon teams), and master hand, plus three bonus stages (break the targets, snag the trophies and race to the finish). board the platforms is no more.there are a ton of new multiplayer modes to, which only add to the fun. want some quick k.o.'s? then give super sudden death mode a try and have everyone handicapped at 300% damage! do you like your fights faster? slower maybe? lightning and slo-mo melees are available. trying to become a photographer? then give camera mode a try. also, a tournament can be held with up to 64 players.there is so much more that i could discuss (trophies, multi-man melee, etc.), but if this hasn't convinced you that this game is worth having, as dated as it may be now that brawl is out for the wii, then i'm sorry for you. trust me, it is.\""

              "\"the negative review from game informer almost kept me from buying this game, but I am glad that i decided to buy it anyway.  I will go over each of the core aspects of the game and give you what i liked and what i did not.                              combat      has a very god of war like feel to it. in fact, much of the game does. if you feel that a god of war style presentation or combat system strays too far from castlevania's roots then you may not like it, but if you enjoyed the combat in god of war you will like it here as well.you have   main melee weapons. the shadow whip is the weapon you will use most often and it has the best range. the void sword has a shorter range but replenishes health when you strike enemies with it. the chaos claws deal the most damage but have short range, and are the only weapons that can deal damage to some shielded foes.each weapon has it is own skill tree. there are skill trees that you can progress in as you gain experience points. you can also  master  certain skills by using them more. once mastered, they become more effective in combat. this encourages you to use combos and skills that you may not have otherwise used as often, so that you can master them as well.you also have access to projectiles like daggers, which do different things depending on which melee weapon you have equipped, you can send a swarm of bats to distract enemies for the stealth sections, and several relics exist that can be used as limited items such as the classic hourglass that slows enemies' movement, a bird that can reveal secret locations, a health replenishing flask, and others.the camera can be a bit of an annoyance at times as it tends to leave some enemies off screen and you may not realize that they are about to attack, which leaves you vulnerable.my only other complaint is that it is sometimes difficult to perform a lengthy combo as most enemies do not get  stun locked  by your attacks and can then break your combo by hitting you, even while you are hitting them.                               story      the game is almost too story heavy at first, forcing you to sit through quite a few narrated scenes. they are important, however, as the belmont lineage and their place in the story needs to be examined. an artful presentation at least makes these scenes interesting to look at while they fill you in on back story.ultimately the story is pretty interesting especially if you have followed along with lords of shadow and the mirror of fate.                                   graphics      not a bad looking game, but not top of the line either. some of the meshes have some pretty jagged edges, particularly when at a distance, even with settings maxed. some of the shadows light during cut scenes can appear unrealistic and distracting when the jagged edged shadows tend to spill over the curvature of the characters' faces, etc. this is not uncommon in gaming at the moment however.this game is heavy on blood  as can be expected , but in some moments when blood is shooting up or exploding out, it does not look very fluid. again, not an easy thing to model and animate, but still needs to be pointed out.                           other gameplay      much criticism has been leveled at the game's stealth sections, although i did not find them to be overly unpleasant. changing into rat form to explore air vents or tunnels is actually fairly fun. my biggest complaint about the stealth sections is that you are not allowed to engage in combat, which is where the game shines. it almost seems arbitrarily thrown in, as if the developers wanted another aspect to the gameplay besides combat and exploration.much worse than the stealth sections are the platforming sections. swinging on chandeliers is a series staple, but in this game it feels clunky and bothersome. climbing feels fairly natural though and can be compared to games like uncharted or god of war.the game does allow for that metroidvania style exploration however. although most of the environments are not truly open world, they are large enough to allow for exploration and finding secrets. many of the secret areas cannot be accessed until you have the appropriate skill or item, much like other castlevania games, metroid games or zelda games.                                  art presentation      i applaud the designers for thinking outside the box and bringing the series into the modern era, but that is my biggest complaint about the setting. although much of the game is in modern times, you will still find yourself in gothic environments with old dilapidated castles, cathedrals and buildings, which keeps it from being too futuristic. i think we can all agree that dracula fighting enemies in times square would be a huge mistake, and the developers avoided that pitfall. still, seeing an electronic billboard or steel doors that can only be opened by a retina scanner just do not feel like they belong.make no mistake though, there is plenty of dark imagery, horrific and grotesque monsters, and dim hallways with flickering candlelight.                         audio      the soundtrack is fantastic. the sound effects feel right at home. if i had one complaint it is that some of the characters' voice actors are not quite up to par, but most of the major characters do a good job, especially patrick stewart who voices zobek.                            in conclusion, this is a very enjoyable game that brings the lords of shadow series to a close in style. the stealth and platforming sections keep it from being a true masterpiece, but they are not so frequent as to ruin the rest of the great things this game has to offer. buy with confidence and enjoy!\""

              "\"a man phones a lawyer and asks,  how much would you charge for just answering three simple questions? the lawyer replies,  a thousand dollars.  a thousand dollars!  exclaims the man.  that is very expensive is not it?  it certainly is,  says the lawyer.  now, what is your third question? or this one...q  what do you have if three lawyers are buried up to their necks in cement?a  not enough cement.the usa network keeps on not effing up. far as I am concerned, suits is the newest addictive show on television, and that is me not normally drawn to legal dramas. it is witty and funny and smart and loaded with that patented easy breezy sense of fun that the usa network nowadays specializes in. the premise is irresistible, the cast is irrepressible. the two leads, gabriel macht and patrick j. adams, are so very good. i can not not rave.suits chronicles the exploits of the prestigious new york corporate law firm pearson hardman. more pointedly, the catchy premise revolves around sleek newly made senior partner harvey specter  macht  who dips into shady shenanigans when he takes under his wing a college dropout who was running away from the law when he happened to stumble across harvey's office just when harvey was in the middle of interviewing first year associates. turns out, there is more to mike ross  adams  than just being a slacker and a weed merchant. mike boasts an eidetic memory. he reads something, he understands it. once he understands it, he never forgets it. it is a neat party trick. it intrigues harvey enough, impresses him enough, that he decides to gamble on mike. and since pearson hardman only ever hires from a pool of harvard law graduates, then begins the big fib of mike ross, harvey's new associate and recent harvard alumni.mike ross is a resourceful, idealistic cat  that whole weed thing was a one time mistake . he makes for a terrific point of view character. as he navigates his way around his new environment, as he learns, we learn. will mike sink or swim in these shark infested waters? that is part of the fun. in just about each episode, mike is thrown a curve, is put in a situation in which he could get exposed. sometimes, his quick thinking and his immaculate sense of recall get him out of predicament. sometimes, harvey, cool as the other side of the pillow, steps in. how long can these two keep up the charade? the show dares you to step away.macht, gleam all wicked in his eye and so much hair gel the headrest of his barcalounger is afraid, embodies harvey specter with supreme swagger, cocky and ruthless and unruffled. once in a blue moon he exhibits his  begrudgingly  compassionate side. harvey is touted as the firm's go to closer, its most heralded gunslinger. in his competitive field, it is no surprise that his colleagues are resentful. and maybe none more envious than the always scheming junior partner louis litt  that fabulous gopher rick hoffman . hoffman is great as the perennial burr in the saddle. he quickly makes mike's time in the firm a partly sucky one. mike becomes the human rope in harvey and louis' ongoing game of tug of war.q  what do you throw to a drowning lawyer?a  his partners.let me fragment sentence you  predatory boardroom sharks, cooly preening and posturing and bedeviling clients with silver tongues, and yet graced with just enough of that bump of conscience to humanize them. i found myself suckered into that simmer between mike and sexy, five year paralegal rachel  meghan markle . i relish the hell out of sarah rafferty who plays harvey's sassy secretary donna, and we note donna's understated pining for her boss. in fact, the interactions among the cast members are absorbing all around. gina torres as the firm's steely managing  and founding  partner is the icing on the cake. the cases handled by harvey and mike are watchable enough, and the legalese thrown at us is made decipherable enough. for those trying to become better people, morals and ethics are explored intelligently. each time i side with mike's naive nice guy perspective, harvey extends a counter argument which sheds a new light on the matter. my favorite moments are those in which harvey sarcastically mentors mike  with mike frequently giving as good as he gets  and those moments in which mike scrambles to maintain his harvard cover. and i do not mind at all any scene in which the weasely louis litt gets what is coming to him. and let me reiterate  suits is funny. I am already   episodes deep into season  , and, if anything, I have gotten even more hooked. in season  , the stakes have shot up even more. as for season one, get it. get it now.the suits dvd set contains all twelve episodes of season one and comes in three discs and with the following bonus stuff   pilot extended version  audio commentaries on   episodes  the pilot episode and the season finale  dogfight   both eps with exec. producer david bartis, creator co exec. producer aaron korsh, gabriel macht and patrick j. adams   deleted scenes for   episodes  gag reel    minutes    cross examination   gabriel macht, meghan markle, patrick j. adams, rick hoffman, aaron korsh and david bartis sit down to a q   a session    minutes okay, last one q  what do you get when you cross a bad politician with a crooked lawyer?a  chelsea clinton.\""

              "'this is a very unique and challenging game.  you must study the game board carefully and chose your moves with care, because there is only once correct solution.  the object of the game is to link \"spirits\" in groups of two/three (depending on the level).  the spirits must all be on the same row or column but they don\\'t have to be touching.  this is not a connect-three game!pros: :heavy_check_mark:  very unique game concept.  something i haven\\'t seen before. :heavy_check_mark:  graphics are great. :heavy_check_mark:  options to turn off both music and sound. :heavy_check_mark:  you can shake the game to restart the level once you have no more moves (ie: you lost).cons:  you have to shake the device really, really hard to get it to restart the game.  don\\'t like totemo\\'s little stories.  too bad there isn\\'t an option to turn them off.  but there is a \"skip\" button in the bottom right corner that lets you skip the entire dialog.  the game can get frustrating (frustrating enough to quit) if you can\\'t solve the puzzle.  a \"hint\" feature would be nice.  no scoring.  there is one little ad that pops up (radiant defense).  but the game looks interesting so i might just have to buy it.so in summary this is a great game.  it is wonderful when a developer can come up with something fresh and exciting.  kudos to hexage.'"
