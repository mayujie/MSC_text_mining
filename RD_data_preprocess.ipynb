The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent \\'prayer of the bone\" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don\\'t get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It\\'s just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.  Lets hope this show continues on for many years to come.']"

              "\"obviously this pen is not a very expensive fountain pen that is a 'showpiece', rather it is an everyday pen that should survive daily use and is a replacement for a ballpoint or rollerball pen. it takes a bit of use to get formalized to using a fountain pen and sometimes you may find it skipping especially when it has air pockets in the chamber or you're at a strange angle. this is expected but that is the fun and uniqueness of using such a pen. it is plastic but very sold (not weight wise but feel wise). the clip is large but this is a good thing if you carry it in your pocket and want it to be secure. the nib is a fine nib but from reading other sites, it seems as if the size is closer to a medium. (japan nibs vs. german?). whatever; the script is very close to my other nibs labeled as medium. this is a very good everyday thickness; not too fine and not too broad. the one cartridge it comes with is blue. i would recommend buying a good bottle of ink and a z24 converter. this up front cost will surely save you a lot of money if you intend to actually use your pen. i have read many reviews that recommend filling this converter directly from the bottle and not while it is in the pen. this would be easy if the bottle is full. lamy recommends filling the pen with the converter inside the pen and filling through the nib. it seems as if the outcome is the same. the following link is lamy's video on how to fill the z26 and z24; they are the same procedures.  <YOUTUBEURL> \""

              "'canon pixma mg5420 wireless color photo printer with scanner and copier[12/13/2013 note: i suggest also looking at the canon pixma mg7120 if you are interested in the mg5420][12/22/2013 note: i added a section below noting why the mg5420 is superior to the mg5520 in my opinion]overview:----------if you don\\'t care about having gray or ethernet, but want great photo quality in an inexpensive all-in-one style (copier, scanner) ink jet printer, this can be a quality/value sweet spot for you in the canon pixma line giving you a lot of bang for the buck.  this is the replacement for mg5320, only available since december 2012.if this seems right for you, consider looking at the slightly more upscale canon mg7120 features before committing as the cost difference isn\\'t that much.pros:------- a well regarded consumer magazine considers these mg5000/mg6000/mg8000 series printers the best photo quality for all-in-one (copier, scanner) ink jets.  this model is the entry point into this line.- the new ink tanks for the mg5420 (and the new mg6320 and newer mg7120) now also come in an xl size which can reduce the page cost significantly.  the inks themselves in the new tanks are the same formula.  this was not available for the predecessor mg5320/mg6220 models.- the mg5420 (and mg6320/mg7120) has 2x the number of black ink nozzles as their predecessors mg5320/mg6220.  this allows more efficient use of black ink and greater dot accuracy.- it is a bit shorter/squatter than its predecessor mg5320, which for some is a nicer form factor if on a desk, for example.  i think they both look fine, but it is clear from reviews that the new look has gone over well.- like the newer mg6320/mg7120 (and unlike the last generation mg5320/mg6220), this has the new handy separate 4\"x6\" and 5\"x7\" photo paper drawer at the front.- for copying/scanning the top comes off easily (unlike the previous generation mg5320/mg6220).- with 10+ years of having a number of their products i have always found canon to have great customer service, which for u.s. customers appears to be based out of maryland and virginia.lesser pros:-------------- 5-15% faster printing than last generation depending on b&w; vs. color, quality, etc.- can print directly from cf memory cards unlike the last generation, if that is important to you.- wider selection of devices that can print directly to it than the last generation.cons/warnings:------------------ like its predecessor (mg5320), this has one less color than the next step up mg6320/mg6220, it does not have gray, which is for improved black and white art and photo results and to better darken colors.  i can\\'t tell the difference gray makes with color pages, but some reviewers can.- like its predecessor (mg5320), there is no ethernet connection like the next step up mg7120/mg6320/mg6220 has.  ethernet allows a solid, simple shared/network wired connection that stays up even when computers are down.  i personally think getting this is worth the relatively small additional expense for a mg7120/mg6320/mg6220 if you have more than one user on the network, but that is just me.- does not have the option of coming in white, which the mg7120/mg6320 ones do.- as of 2014 this is no longer new (end of 2012) and as such one hopes most issues found with it would have been fixed by now.  however, if you are buying a used one, this may still be a concern.- the inks for this model (and the other newer ones, the mg6320/mg7120) are relatively new and different than for the previous generation before that (mg5320/mg6220) and thus can be harder to find in stores, however enough time has passed now as of 2014 it is no where near as tough to find as only a year ago.- for copying/scanning, the lid telescopes up for books only to the thickness of around a cellphone (like its predecessor the mg5320).  on the other hand the top comes off easily now with the mg5420, just like the newer mg6320/mg7120.- this doesn\\'t come with the mg6320/mg7120\\'s touch screen content-sensitive interface which is getting rave reviews, however, i find this older interface style just as easy.- no built-in fax, if this is important to you in an all-in-one.  perhaps you want to get a dedicated one of your choosing near a phone line anyways, however if you are looking for a built-in fax the mx922/mx892 printers do.  this comes at a cost of not getting the higher end scanning of the mg models, though this may only matter to you if you are scanning negatives, mx922/mx892 scanning meets most other needs including most graphics needs, just as well.suggestions to consider:----------------------------- when doing text, choose the high quality setting (and perhaps set it as the default) in the printer page set-up, it really makes a difference.- see below consideration to select it not to automatically shut-off to reduce ink wastage.- consider choosing to print black & white or grey scale when color isn\\'t necessary, otherwise the printer may choose to layer colors to get black instead.  canon feels the black is better with the color layering though, you decide :).- if you need something now that you will use a lot now, and the gray and ethernet is potentially useful you might consider looking at the older mg6220 since it uses inks that are easy to find at stores and online.  the mg6220 is pretty cheap now, too, since it is being replaced.- if you need something now that you will use a lot now, and you don\\'t care enough about gray or ethernet, you might consider looking at the older mg5320 since it uses inks that are easy to find at stores and online.  the mg5320 is pretty cheap now, too, since it is being replaced.- if the color gray or ethernet connectivity (they come with mg7120/mg6320/mg6220) is potentially useful to you, you might consider looking into the mg7120/mg6320/mg6220, which are otherwise somewhat similar.- use canon paper when you need optimal results with their ink, and test matte vs. glossy.  matte is much less expensive and may meet most of your needs.  let me know in comments if anyone finds a comparable quality and yet significantly less costly photo paper for this printer, i\\'d like to test it out.- in case of power outage, it is sometimes necessary to unplug it for a few minutes and then plug it back in. this allows capacitor discharge.- the canon site has lots of easy to find product comparison information for these inkjets, you might consider reviewing it before committing on a model.- as soon as you can after getting your printer, print samples of full color, b&w;, borderless photos, print on a dvd if that\\'s important to you, etc.  determine if you have a lemon before you get too busy with other things so you can exchange for a good one while it is easy to do.  these are complicated machines with lots of parts.ink usage:-----------anyone researching the ink jet printers will likely be concerned about ink costs.  here are 5 things you can do to mitigate this with the mg5420:- buy the xl versions of the ink, this is supposed to reduce the cost per color page to a very competitive 13-14 cents per page (vs. 16-19 cents).- as noted above, choose to print black and white or grey scale when that will do just fine to avoid black made from layers of colors.  canon feels the black mixed from colors is better, you be the judge.- turn off the automatic shut-off.  standby mode uses 0.9w, so on standby even all year uses around 8kwh/yr., so around $1/yr depending on where you live.  this can help lessen the number of the longer cleaning routines after start-up and often at shutdown.  it runs the cleaning other times, too, which is good as it keeps things from clogging.- avoid printing pages with solid or heavily colored background in color when possible.- some fonts use 20-40% less ink than others.  according to a leading consumer magazine, times uses much less than arial which uses much less than calibri, for example.note #1:  if there is no printing or cleaning routine at least once a month or so, select it to run a cleaning routine (easy to do) or turn it off and on to force it to once a month or so to keep the nozzles unclogged.  if they clog talk to canon support for what is often an easy solution.note #2:  the mg6220, which is in the same family of products as this mg5420 (though part of an earlier model line up), has a low ink early warning bug.  for example, when i take ink from a mg5320 and put it in a mg6220, the low ink warning bars show the ink as vastly lower.  this helps exaggerate the appearance of high ink usage.  actual ink usage is high enough that this bug is pretty unwelcome.  if it wasn\\'t for a leading consumer magazine\\'s highest photo quality rating for all-in-ones and their estimated page cost that wasn\\'t crazy, and lots of other favorable reviews, i think this bug could have been much worse for mg6220 sales and other models in the family.  this might make you feel a little better about ink usage in the model family 5000/6000 after reading the ink comments for the 6220.note #3:  just an informative, probably not very useful factoid :).  this model range of canon inkjet doesn\\'t do a big cleaning/purging after it prints, you are usually hearing head realignment.  however, it does quietly \"prime the head\" to keep the heat from ink clogging the print head and this uses a little ink (even for b&w;).  this is much less ink than with the big cleaning/purging routine that is much rarer if you set the printer not to auto shut-off.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ink usage canon datasheet:------------------------------as it is pretty difficult to find, here below is canon\\'s published page yield per document numbers (i rounded a little) for mg5420.i\\'m not sure how much of the difference between these numbers and users experience is due to the cleaning routine, difference between test and real world usage, etc.here at least you can see real world expected usage ratio between standard and xl cartridges and compare to costs to determine the better value.----------mixed text/graphics, a4/letter, plain paper, adobe reader 10iso/iec24711 test method, iso/iec24712 test pattern:pgi-250 __ 300 pagescli-251 bk 1800cli-251 c_ 330cli-251 m_

mg5420\\'s favor:mg5420:- print color resolution: 9600 horizontal x 2400 vertical dpi- print most granular dot: 1 picoliter- scanner resolution: 2400 horizontal x 4800 vertical dpi (optical)- print 4\"x6\" photo speed: 21 seconds- copy speed (fcot): 14 seconds- printing on dvd/cd\\'smg5520:- print color resolution: 4800 horizontal x 1200 vertical dpi*- print most granular dot: 2 picoliter- scanner resolution: 1200 horizontal x 2400 vertical dpi (optical)**- print 4\"x6\" photo speed: 44 seconds (110% slower)- copy speed (fcot): 20 seconds (40% slower)- no printing on dvd/cd\\'s*the mg5520\\'s 4800 horizontal x 2400 vertical max dpi color printing will meet most needs. the pro photo inkjet printers (pro-1/pro-10/pro-100) even max out at 4800 horizontal dpi (though have finer vertical stepping capability), for example. be sure to use specially designed paper (for example, enter \"canon paper_guide\" in a search engine) to really see the difference of the higher resolution. also, print from an application in which you can choose the profile for that paper (ex: many adobe products) if possible, too.**the mg5520\\'s 1200 horizontal x 2400 vertical max dpi scan will meet most needs (though it is too low for some film/slide scanning needs especially if you plan to enlarge). for example, even a 2.5\"x3.5\" paper photo scanned at 1200dpi may enlarge to 8x10 comfortably, though frankly you will be fortunate if that amount of info is even available from the photo. it is therefore also moot to argue enlargement benefits of over 1200dpi scanning of paper photos as the detail is likely not there for over 1200dpi.some pros of mg5520 over mg5420:- mg5520 will automatically turn on if it is off when a print request is sent.- mg5520 doesn\\'t require a wireless router to print from a mobile device, it has an access point mode which allows direct printing to the printer without need for a wireless router.- mg5520 allows you to print directly (no computer needed) from facebook, twitter, flickr, dropbox, evernote, and more, via apps downloaded to the printer.summary:i don\\'t think the few ancillary pros of the mg5520 outweigh mg5420\\'s superior features, though the info is there to make your own call. and if you want your cake and to eat it, too, the mg7120 for a bit more money will give you the benefits of the mg5420 plus the mg5520 benefits, plus the gray toner tank and ethernet to boot.other printers:-----------------for folks not as familiar with printers, i created this section to help delineate when you clearly don\\'t want a canon ink jet printer in the popular 5320/5420/6210/6220/6320/82xx model range at all.  perhaps it may help you find a good starting point to meet your needs.you are all about photos, canspend hundreds more, and

              "'i\\'ve had theepson b11b198011 perfection v600 photo scannerfor two years. i compared it side-by-side with the v370 using the epson software and also vuescan by hamrick software.here is the concise comparison, based on the most common scanning tasks:quick document scan: both scanners handle this with one button. both use leds instead of fluorescent bulbs, so there is no warm-up delay. there\\'s virtually no difference between them. use the included epson software.occasional photo scans: both scanners excel at this, again with one button. no difference between them. use the epson softwareocr: both scanners include ocr software. depending on your application, both do an acceptable job. take your time, line up the pages carefully, rescan when a page has lots of errors. neither scanner has an automatic document feeder, so you won\\'t be hand-feeding 100 pages without some fatigue. no difference between the scanners.book/object scans: this is something i didn\\'t know i would need before getting the v600. but if the scanner does not have a hinged lid designed for objects thicker than a piece of paper, it will be a major inconvenience to scan a book or a 3d object (i\\'ve scanned remote controls, artwork, school projects, etc.). both scanners have a well-designed hinged lid, and work very well with thick books.film scanning: this is where you start to see a difference between these two scanners. if you have only occasional slides or negatives to scan, the v370 does an acceptable job. however, it\\'s resolution is 4800 dpi vs 6400 dpi for the v600. this makes a real and noticeable difference with film, because the original is small and you want all the resolution you can get. in addition, the v600 has a secondary infrared lamp for film scanning, which can make a significant difference for color slides and negatives because it makes dust \"disappear.\" the v370 does not have an ir lamp.high resolution scanning: many people put a bit much emphasis on scanner resolution. the fact is, if you are not scanning film or doing some type of technical work where you zoom way in to an image, you will seldom scan a full-size original at the full resolution of the scanner, because each scan will be hundreds of megabytes! the resolution of the v600 is much higher than that of the v370, which will only make a difference if you scan film or do highly-detailed work. if you don\\'t already know you have an application like this for the 6400 dpi of the v600, it is unlikely you will need more resolution than the 4800 dpi of the v370.epson software (included): the epson software has gotten better with every release. the newest version for the v370 does photo stitching and direct scanning to cloud accounts, in addition to one-button scanning and photo repair. epson gives you four modes to choose from, each with a few more controls to tweak. my daughter will not touch vuescan (see below) because the one-click epson software does a great job for many jobs, and the professional mode gives access to most settings to improve your scans. mac and windows are both well supported (i tested os x 10.6 and windows 7).vuescan support: vuescan from hamrick software is an amazing third-party product that gives you significantly better control of every aspect of your scans. i\\'ve used it since buying the v600. i downloaded the latest release, which directly supports the v370, to do this review. however, i realized something: the included epson software has gotten so good, casual or intermediate scanner users are unlikely to ever need vuescan. and if you do need the extra control and features of vuescan, you probably want the v600 scanner.this is the key finding of this comparison: if you are the kind of person who will spend many hours scanning hundreds of photos, and learning how to tweak every possible setting to get the best scan before importing it into photoshop for further manipulation, then you want the v600. if you are an a less technical user who doesn\\'t adjust digital photos in photoshop or tweak scans in vuescan, then you will be thrilled with the v370 with its included software. both of these products are light years ahead of what scanners could do 10 years ago.summary: buy the v370 unless you are a photoshop guru who loves to tweak, or you have a lot of highly-detailed scanning work that requires 6400 dpi resolution. the v600 will do a significantly better job on negatives or slides, but if you have lots of film to scan, look into a film scanner.'"

              "'i just finished watching \"dead hooker in a trunk\" by and starring the soska twins.  jen and sylvia play the leads in one seriously messed up grindhouse-y indie horror film (their first).  originally planned to star four female leads, someone apparently dropped out and one of the characters was re-written days before shooting began to be a male.so while this would have been a different film if it starred and entirely female cast, i have to say the inclusion of c.j. wallis as \"goody two shoes\" was a stroke of luck.  although he was busy co-starring in the film, as noted on imdb he also \"...edited, shot, sound tracked, marketed, and did all post on the film.\"  he is absolutely hilarious in this film and show a key sense of comedic timing.as for the soska twins...what can i say.  smart, sexy, dark and a little disturbing...well a lot disturbing.  at one point, i realized that they might be just playing themselves (seemed so natural as loopy twins).so how was the movie?  for an indie first time horror film i have to say hats off to these ladies.  they really took on an ambitious amount of locations, story, and action for a first film.  i wasn\\'t sure what the film would look like or feel like, but having seen it would argue it\\'s very much a \"grindhouse\" film as much as \"horror.\"is there blood?  guts?  violence?  absolutely.  the twins handle ever increasing horror, violence, confusion and surreal accidents with passion and strength.  while one sister (\"geek\" played by jen) is a bit of a wallflower, it\\'s soon apparent that she\\'s not just a brainy beauty but able to step into the shadows.  her sister (\"badass\" played by sylvia) is a loose cannon dealing rage, violence and death blows without hesitation.  these two excite, frighten and subdue all who come in their way.the plot is a bit light and confusing at times (essentially a serial killer stalking hookers and following the twins after said hooker ends up in the trunk of badass\\'s car), but overall it keeps moving at a frenetic pace and you don\\'t often linger on any scene.i guess i am a twisted, dark soul (see my book \"dark bites\") so much of the blood, violence and guts was very familiar to me and often made me laugh out loud.  there were some genuine, \"i didn\\'t see it coming\" moments that made me jump (batter up).is it perfect?  no, but it\\'s a really great, ambitious first step to the dark side.  they wrote something and made it happen-that alone should be demand our support (in particular from those of us in the horror community).  but you\\'ll also enjoy some great music (a trifle loud over the dialogue at times), kick ass gals put in insane situations and a lot of gory/violence.  i suspect and anticipate that with success, more time/budget/equipment they\\'ll have ever increasing success making horror films we can all fall in love with.i recommend you rent this movie and leave a review here and follow these ladies as i do on twitter ( <MENTION> ).  stay bloody!'"

Far as I\\'m concerned, SUITS is the newest addictive show on television, and that\\'s me not normally drawn to legal dramas.

The two leads, Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams, are so very good. I can\\'t not rave.SUITS chronicles the exploits of the prestigious New York corporate law firm Pearson Hardman. More pointedly, the catchy premise revolves around sleek newly-made senior partner Harvey Specter (Macht) who dips into shady shenanigans when he takes under his wing a college dropout who was running away from the law when he happened to stumble across Harvey\\'s office just when Harvey was in the middle of interviewing first year associates. Turns out, there\\'s more to Mike Ross (Adams) than just being a slacker and a weed merchant. Mike boasts an eidetic memory. He reads something, he understands it. Once he understands it, he never forgets it. It\\'s a neat party trick. It intrigues Harvey enough, impresses him enough, that he decides to gamble on Mike. And since Pearson Hardman only ever hires from a pool of Harvard law graduates, then begins the big fib of Mike Ross, Harvey\\'s new associate and recent Harvard alumni.Mike Ross is a resourceful, idealistic cat (that whole weed thing was a one-time mistake). He makes for a terrific point-of-view character. As he navigates his way around his new environment, as he learns, we learn. Will Mike sink or swim in these shark-infested waters? That\\'s part of the fun. In just about each episode, Mike is thrown a curve, is put in a situation in which he could get exposed.

Once in a blue moon he exhibits his (begrudgingly) compassionate side. Harvey is touted as the firm\\'s go-to closer, its most heralded gunslinger. In his competitive field, it\\'s no surprise that his colleagues are resentful. And maybe none more envious than the always scheming junior partner Louis Litt (that fabulous gopher Rick Hoffman). Hoffman is great as the perennial burr in the saddle. He quickly makes Mike\\'s time in the firm a partly sucky one. Mike becomes the human rope in Harvey and Louis\\' ongoing game of tug-of-war.Q: What do you throw to a drowning lawyer?A: His partners.Let me fragment sentence you: Predatory boardroom sharks, cooly preening and posturing and bedeviling clients with silver tongues, and yet graced with just enough of that bump of conscience to humanize them. I found myself suckered into that simmer between Mike and sexy, five-year paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markle). I relish the hell out of Sarah Rafferty who plays Harvey\\'s sassy secretary Donna, and we note Donna\\'s understated pining for her boss. In fact, the interactions among the cast members are absorbing all around. Gina Torres as the firm\\'s steely managing (and founding) partner is the icing on the cake.

I\\'m already 5 episodes deep into Season 2, and, if anything, I\\'ve gotten even more hooked. In Season 2, the stakes have shot up even more. As for Season One, get it. Get it now.The SUITS DVD set contains all twelve episodes of Season One and comes in three discs and with the following bonus stuff:- Pilot Extended Version- Audio Commentaries on 2 episodes: the pilot episode and the season finale \"Dogfight\" (both eps with exec. producer David Bartis, creator/co-exec. producer Aaron Korsh, Gabriel Macht and Patrick J.
