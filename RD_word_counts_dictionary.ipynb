The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent \\'prayer of the bone\" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don\\'t get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It\\'s just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.  Lets hope this show continues on for many years to come.']"

              "'The negative review from Game Informer almost kept me from buying this game, but I\\'m glad that I decided to buy it anyway.  I\\'ll go over each of the core aspects of the game and give you what I liked and what I didn\\'t.==============================Combat (4/5)Has a very God of War like feel to it. In fact, much of the game does. If you feel that a God of War style presentation or combat system strays too far from Castlevania\\'s roots then you may not like it, but if you enjoyed the combat in God of War you\\'ll like it here as well.You have 3 main melee weapons. The Shadow Whip is the weapon you\\'ll use most often and it has the best range. The Void Sword has a shorter range but replenishes health when you strike enemies with it. The Chaos Claws deal the most damage but have short range, and are the only weapons that can deal damage to some shielded foes.Each weapon has it\\'s own skill tree. There are skill trees that you can progress in as you gain experience points. You can also \"master\" certain skills by using them more. Once mastered, they become more effective in combat. This encourages you to use combos and skills that you may not have otherwise used as often, so that you can master them as well.You also have access to projectiles like daggers, which do different things depending on which melee weapon you have equipped, you can send a swarm of bats to distract enemies for the stealth sections, and several relics exist that can be used as limited items such as the classic hourglass that slows enemies\\' movement, a bird that can reveal secret locations, a health replenishing flask, and others.The camera can be a bit of an annoyance at times as it tends to leave some enemies off-screen and you may not realize that they\\'re about to attack, which leaves you vulnerable.My only other complaint is that it\\'s sometimes difficult to perform a lengthy combo as most enemies don\\'t get \"stun locked\" by your attacks and can then break your combo by hitting you, even while you\\'re hitting them.===============================Story (4/5)The game is almost too story heavy at first, forcing you to sit through quite a few narrated scenes. They\\'re important, however, as the Belmont lineage and their place in the story needs to be examined. An artful presentation at least makes these scenes interesting to look at while they fill you in on back story.Ultimately the story is pretty interesting especially if you\\'ve followed along with Lords of Shadow and the Mirror of Fate.===================================Graphics (3/5)Not a bad looking game, but not top of the line either. Some of the meshes have some pretty jagged edges, particularly when at a distance, even with settings maxed. Some of the shadows/light during cut scenes can appear unrealistic and distracting when the jagged edged shadows tend to spill over the curvature of the characters\\' faces, etc. This is not uncommon in gaming at the moment however.This game is heavy on blood (as can be expected), but in some moments when blood is shooting up or exploding out, it doesn\\'t look very fluid. Again, not an easy thing to model and animate, but still needs to be pointed out.===========================Other gameplay (3/5)Much criticism has been leveled at the game\\'s stealth sections, although I didn\\'t find them to be overly unpleasant. Changing into rat form to explore air vents or tunnels is actually fairly fun. My biggest complaint about the stealth sections is that you\\'re not allowed to engage in combat, which is where the game shines. It almost seems arbitrarily thrown in, as if the developers wanted another aspect to the gameplay besides combat and exploration.Much worse than the stealth sections are the platforming sections. Swinging on chandeliers is a series staple, but in this game it feels clunky and bothersome. Climbing feels fairly natural though and can be compared to games like Uncharted or God of War.The game does allow for that Metroidvania style exploration however. Although most of the environments are not truly open world, they are large enough to allow for exploration and finding secrets. Many of the secret areas cannot be accessed until you have the appropriate skill or item, much like other Castlevania games, Metroid games or Zelda games.==================================Art/Presentation (4/5)I applaud the designers for thinking outside the box and bringing the series into the modern era, but that\\'s my biggest complaint about the setting. Although much of the game is in modern times, you\\'ll still find yourself in gothic environments with old dilapidated castles, cathedrals and buildings, which keeps it from being too futuristic. I think we can all agree that Dracula fighting enemies in Times Square would be a huge mistake, and the developers avoided that pitfall. Still, seeing an electronic billboard or steel doors that can only be opened by a retina scanner just don\\'t feel like they belong.Make no mistake though, there is plenty of dark imagery, horrific and grotesque monsters, and dim hallways with flickering candlelight.=========================Audio (5/5)The soundtrack is fantastic. The sound effects feel right at home. If I had one complaint it\\'s that some of the characters\\' voice actors aren\\'t quite up to par, but most of the major characters do a good job, especially Patrick Stewart who voices Zobek.============================In conclusion, this is a very enjoyable game that brings the Lords of Shadow series to a close in style. The stealth and platforming sections keep it from being a true masterpiece, but they\\'re not so frequent as to ruin the rest of the great things this game has to offer. Buy with confidence and enjoy!'"

              "'A man phones a lawyer and asks, \"How much would you charge for just answering three simple questions?\"The lawyer replies, \"A thousand dollars.\"\"A thousand dollars!\" exclaims the man. \"That\\'s very expensive isn\\'t it?\"\"It certainly is,\" says the lawyer. \"Now, what\\'s your third question?\"Or this one...Q: What do you have if three lawyers are buried up to their necks in cement?A: Not enough cement.The USA network keeps on not effing up. Far as I\\'m concerned, SUITS is the newest addictive show on television, and that\\'s me not normally drawn to legal dramas. It\\'s witty and funny and smart and loaded with that patented easy-breezy sense of fun that the USA network nowadays specializes in. The premise is irresistible, the cast is irrepressible. The two leads, Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams, are so very good. I can\\'t not rave.SUITS chronicles the exploits of the prestigious New York corporate law firm Pearson Hardman. More pointedly, the catchy premise revolves around sleek newly-made senior partner Harvey Specter (Macht) who dips into shady shenanigans when he takes under his wing a college dropout who was running away from the law when he happened to stumble across Harvey\\'s office just when Harvey was in the middle of interviewing first year associates. Turns out, there\\'s more to Mike Ross (Adams) than just being a slacker and a weed merchant. Mike boasts an eidetic memory. He reads something, he understands it. Once he understands it, he never forgets it. It\\'s a neat party trick. It intrigues Harvey enough, impresses him enough, that he decides to gamble on Mike. And since Pearson Hardman only ever hires from a pool of Harvard law graduates, then begins the big fib of Mike Ross, Harvey\\'s new associate and recent Harvard alumni.Mike Ross is a resourceful, idealistic cat (that whole weed thing was a one-time mistake). He makes for a terrific point-of-view character. As he navigates his way around his new environment, as he learns, we learn. Will Mike sink or swim in these shark-infested waters? That\\'s part of the fun. In just about each episode, Mike is thrown a curve, is put in a situation in which he could get exposed. Sometimes, his quick thinking and his immaculate sense of recall get him out of predicament. Sometimes, Harvey, cool as the other side of the pillow, steps in. How long can these two keep up the charade? The show dares you to step away.Macht, gleam all wicked in his eye and so much hair gel the headrest of his Barcalounger is afraid, embodies Harvey Specter with supreme swagger, cocky and ruthless and unruffled. Once in a blue moon he exhibits his (begrudgingly) compassionate side. Harvey is touted as the firm\\'s go-to closer, its most heralded gunslinger. In his competitive field, it\\'s no surprise that his colleagues are resentful. And maybe none more envious than the always scheming junior partner Louis Litt (that fabulous gopher Rick Hoffman). Hoffman is great as the perennial burr in the saddle. He quickly makes Mike\\'s time in the firm a partly sucky one. Mike becomes the human rope in Harvey and Louis\\' ongoing game of tug-of-war.Q: What do you throw to a drowning lawyer?A: His partners.Let me fragment sentence you: Predatory boardroom sharks, cooly preening and posturing and bedeviling clients with silver tongues, and yet graced with just enough of that bump of conscience to humanize them. I found myself suckered into that simmer between Mike and sexy, five-year paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markle). I relish the hell out of Sarah Rafferty who plays Harvey\\'s sassy secretary Donna, and we note Donna\\'s understated pining for her boss. In fact, the interactions among the cast members are absorbing all around. Gina Torres as the firm\\'s steely managing (and founding) partner is the icing on the cake. The cases handled by Harvey and Mike are watchable enough, and the legalese thrown at us is made decipherable enough. For those trying to become better people, morals and ethics are explored intelligently. Each time I side with Mike\\'s naive nice guy perspective, Harvey extends a counter-argument which sheds a new light on the matter. My favorite moments are those in which Harvey sarcastically mentors Mike (with Mike frequently giving as good as he gets) and those moments in which Mike scrambles to maintain his Harvard cover. And I don\\'t mind at all any scene in which the weasely Louis Litt gets what\\'s coming to him. And let me reiterate: SUITS is FUNNY. I\\'m already 5 episodes deep into Season 2, and, if anything, I\\'ve gotten even more hooked. In Season 2, the stakes have shot up even more. As for Season One, get it. Get it now.The SUITS DVD set contains all twelve episodes of Season One and comes in three discs and with the following bonus stuff:- Pilot Extended Version- Audio Commentaries on 2 episodes: the pilot episode and the season finale \"Dogfight\" (both eps with exec. producer David Bartis, creator/co-exec. producer Aaron Korsh, Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams)- Deleted Scenes for 7 episodes- Gag Reel (00:04:13 minutes)- \"Cross Examination\": Gabriel Macht, Meghan Markle, Patrick J. Adams, Rick Hoffman, Aaron Korsh and David Bartis sit down to a Q & A session (00:10:29 minutes)Okay, last one:Q: What do you get when you cross a bad politician with a crooked lawyer?A: Chelsea Clinton.'"
