              "\"UPDATE, 12/09/13: this machine is WAY OVERPRICED, now.  I got mine for maybe $400, will check and write an updated note in the comments.  It wasn't worth the amount I paid, much less the selling price now.UPDATE 12/09/13: I finally gave up and reinstalled my prior MFC 9700.  It scans well.  This 8480DN cannot scan directly from the machine, but ONLY from the computer.  However, at least the 8480DN has a power button, along with wire hookup in two ways, parallel and USB.  It also allows you to configure it from the computer, without having to use that HORRIBLE LCD menu.  But I gotta tell ya, I'll never buy another Brother printer again.  They didn't learn any lessons from the insanity of the MFC 9700's frustrating interface.UPDATE 3/22/13:  I upgraded one star for the printer, because there is a way to make it do searchable pdf via its PaperPort function.  But the scanner itself can't do that.  YOU can do tht, if you have Acrobat;  its OCR function will also convert any Google doc into searchable pdf (yay, finally I can search Shakespeare and Gibbon)!  Of course this printer can't do that, but once you scan it, even without PaperPort you can take an old Adobe Acrobat 6.0 and render it searchable.  I still prefer my ScanSnap S1500.I still haven't found a way to directly press the scan button ON the machine and have it scan.  But printer quality is excellent.  The rest of the remarks below, still stand.UPDATE 10/13/12:  the scanner does NOT produce searchable pdf.  This makes the scanner nearly useless.  So I downgraded the printer to 2 stars.  Then downgraded it today (1/22/13) because THE SCAN BUTTON DOESN'T WORK on the machine.  You can only scan remotely, from your computer.  Someone in Brother quality control was very thoughtless.  The machine does have some advantages (see below), but I'm giving this low rating to call attention to the UTTER THOUGHTLESSNESS of the design and the manuals.Gist: If you seek a simple fax/scan/copy/printer, look somewhere else.  If you want a sophisticated version with a small footprint and are willing to accept a light duty cycle (30K pages per month -- meaning really no more than 500 per day) -- keep reading.  This machine has fax/scan/copy/print features I can't find elsewhere except in machines costing 2k or more -- cleverly created and handled.  And, it's reliable, a steady workhorse.  Consumable costs are low, for what you get.  When the thing gets tired after about 7 years, it still works fine, but its menu begins to say its drum needs changing, even though that's not true.It will be easier to follow along in this review if you first download the user's manuals on the 8480DN from Brother.  Just Google on that model number and 'manual download', to find the page quickly.  I will no longer buy any electronic product until I've read the manual.  Here, I'm already quite familiar with this line of Brother machines.  But the manuals are a nightmare, so you do need to read them and decide if it's worth the hassle of learning.  Machine itself is of great quality.  Boring putty gray and charcoal color, but hey: business machines are deliberately dull (color chosen by committee vote always means dullish gray or beige or black, yuck).  Well, this one isn't as ugly as some.  Two-toned.Even so, the Brother MFC-8480DN is MUST-BUY, if you still have DOS word processing, because it recognizes PCL 5 language, which back in DOS days was very common.  I'm so thrilled about this:  all my old Multimate Advantage II merge files print as intended.  (MM II used to be the standard DOS word processing in Fortune 500 corporations, and had the easiest-to-program merge functions ever invented.)  My happy history with the elder MFC 9700 and this newer model's PCL 5-6 emulation, were the main reasons I bought this 8480DN.  Saved my bacon for all my 20+ year old client files.Yet the 8480DN can also handle modern stuff, sporting a dual TWAIN and WIA-compliant, Network-capable multifunction fax/color or b&w; scanner/copy/print machine on a legal-size scanning plate, with PCL 5-6 (emulating HP language as well as PostScript), which is compatible with Linux, Windows (through version 7), and Mac:  you get three CDs (Windows pre-7, Windows 7, and Mac) for that reason.  The TWAIN feature allows duplex scanning, but on the 8480DN, I'm not sure how to make it work.  Might not work at all, in XP and prior.  The instructions are ambiguous, probably because the duplex problem is a WINDOWS problem, not the machine's.  Still, you can scan odd then even pages, and re-assemble in Brother's own PaperPort or even via Adobe, to make into a duplex (so I hear).This 8480DN is not automatically set up to handle wireless, but through its Ethernet port you could presumably plug it into a router.  (The 8890DW is supposedly able to do wi-fi out of the box, AND it offers easy duplex scanning;  but I didn't buy that unit.)  You can download the Linux drivers from Brother.  Go to its website, search on 'Linux drivers', and you should get a page of them, with a bunch of model numbers.  So you download, by clicking on the model.  Brother is big on Linux compatibility.=============================================================Sophisticated FOUR-TIER Operation, and Installation (Outline for this Review)=============================================================So, this 8480DN would be a ten-star machine, except for its infuriating, fragmented,  instructions: some options are scattered in the online manual, some only show in the paper manual, some only are listed on the web; some only, in the machine's menu.  But it has a lot of features.  Witness: there are FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS to run this machine, that's why it's so dang confusing.  Ultimately you'll find one way you want to use it, and forget the other options.  But to begin with, you need to know what your options even ARE.1.  Run the machine from its own menu and buttons ON the machine.  Trust me, you will soon hate doing this.  But you will need to learn it, because the other ways of running the scanner, don't include all the options which are ON the machine.  Some important options, like printer emulation mode, are only available from the machine.  The paper manual is correlated to these options, so is relatively easy to read.But alas, not all options you need to configure, are on the machine, so are not covered in that paper manual. So the rest of this review, will cover tips on 8480DN salient features, plus operation via Tiers #2-#4, plus Maintenance.2.  Run the machine from the Brother Control Center options on your computer.  Totally different organization for the many overlapping options, which basically 'tell' the machine how to function;  neither the online nor the paper manual, correlate the same options in the Control Center.  Worse, the online manual isn't organized the way the Control Center displays. Aaarrrggghh.  Not all of the important options are configurable from the computer.  So you have to go through BOTH manuals, but you cannot program in both places at the same time!  So go through the computer options first, then the machine's own options per the paper manual.3.  Run the scanner from the PaperPort Software.  Oddly enough, this is covered in the online manual, where you don't expect it;  also, as would be expected, from the PaperPort's own Help menu.  In my older MFC-9700, when you scan using the machine first -- meaning, you stick the thing to be scanned in the machine and hit the scan button ON the machine  -- the PaperPort menu automatically comes up on the computer.  So presumably that happens with the 8480DN, too.  So this will be the most common computer experience you'll have, if you start your scans at the machine and hit its own buttons.  Unfortunately, I can't get my 8480DN to operate by simply hitting the SCAN button!  EDIT, 10/08/12: I still can't operate the scan button on the machine, must use Control Center to scan.  Since I don't find anyone else having that problem, I must assume it's something wrong on my end, pending talking to Brother.  They want me to call them, and I can't do that until after the 15th.  One quirk in their program: you can't replace an existing file, even if an administrator.  So if you want to rescan with the same file name, you must save to a different directory or first delete the file you originally made.4.  Run the machine's security and permissions, from the web.  Apparently this is for Networking functions by the administrator.  I don't use a network, so won't review this option.  Its function is in the Network User's Guide put on your computer at installation.  The main functions concern who has what kind of access to the MFC 8480DN.  Because, it has a lot of storage capacity (with added memory you can easily add to the side of the machine, too);  so presumably access to its functions, is relegated to an administrator using the cloud.  UPDATE 9/13/12 -- the manager of a large apartment complex with units all over the place told me her 8890DW was completely and swiftly installed REMOTELY by some geek in another state.  He did it all by commands directly to the machine.  No CD required.  So apparently network installation can be heavenly.The rest of this review now focuses on Tier #2 and #3 usage.  These are the most useful and difficult tiers of configuration features, to understand.  There are over 1000 configurable features.  Sadly, Brother's explanations while good, are VERY disorganized.  You will spend HOURS in the pdf manuals, as a) they have no page numbers, and b) their own search engine is dysfunctional (not Adobe's search engine, but their own.  Why?)NOTE TO BROTHER: Organize the pdf according to the Control Center software screens, to lower confused customer calls? Dovetail the at-machine paper manual with the pdf User's manual, so the user can IDENTIFY common functions, versus functions only ON the machine, or only choosable FROM the computer?  You have a good product, Brother -- but oh brother, the convoluted manuals make us tear our hair out!INSTALLATION TIPS: 1) install the software first. 2) DO NOT hook up the USB or Parallel interface to the MFC until told to do so; 3) leave the MFC OFF until told to turn it on.  4) DO NOT select 'Custom' installation: it sends the installer into a hang, for Brother wants to advertise using its own toner brand;  the installer won't complete, else. So, you must install three times (without uninstalling): a) install first WITHOUT Paperport, then b) install again WITH Paperport, then c) do it a third time, to install the only option left, Brother's PostScript driver. Took me four hours to figure out that a) b) c).After installation, there are HUNDREDS of setup options to analyze: 20 customized presets (maybe more). You can also change options ad hoc, right on the machine, though its now-larger LCD menu remains as annoying as ever.  At least now it's backlit and readable.  Whew.Oh: the 8480DN forgets the time, even if unplugged for a moment. To reset it, call up Brother's Control Center menu and use its Remote Setup, Device Settings, Initial Setup: then check the box next to 'PC Clock'.  DO NOT reset the time ON the machine: your PC clock then can't reset it, unless you reboot. Sigh. Okay, but that's all the bad news:  dysfunctional pdf manuals, and a hypersensitive ticker.  Not too bad.Else, this multifunction machine is a huge improvement over its hard-working predecessor, the MFC 9700, which I've owned since about 2005.  So let's see why.=============================================================What can this 8480DN really do?  LOTS.  To wit:=============================================================**  SCAN or print directly to PDF (and other formats), either via your computer, or by itself, with a handy USB port right in front of the machine;  just stick in a pen drive and convert your files on it.  (I have to test this more, to see how it works.)  You can preset 16 sets of options, but only via the computer.  Quality scanning is very slow.  If you want fast, readable but not superlative scans, accept the defaults of 400 or 200 pixels. File sizes are also smaller.  A quality scan will take maybe 20 minutes.  Frankly I don't see much difference between the umpteen bizillion pixels Brother can do, versus the small file standard, but maybe there is a huge difference in photos.  Scanning options are many, creative, and sophisticated.  For example, say you wanted to make a banner. So you print out sections of this 'banner' and now want to 'assemble' it in a scan as one big piece. You can do that.  Or, conversely, scan to fit as many as 25 pages onto one legal or even smaller page.  You can do that.  You can duplex scan, but in two steps, not one; and you have to use PaperPort (covered below), if you're on XP.**  Duplex or simplex PRINTING in black and white, but color for scanning, selectable to very high resolution levels.  Legal size glass, so you can fit more on the scanner.  You can also size the output to shrink up to four pages onto one page.  Via a special option in Direct Print -- where you plug a pen drive into the front of the machine and print what's on the drive, bypassing the computer -- you can shrink as many as 25 pages onto only one page.  The printing options here are enormous and sophisticated, seen on many high-end machines (i.e., make books or pamphlets).  The machine is silent except when printing.  When printing, the chief sound is the fan, windlike; not harsh.  You can hear the paper revv up, too.  Warmup isn't fast, but is acceptable. 32ppm is about right.  It's fast enough for a small office.  It's aggressive about conserving energy, hence the slower warmup.** ADF of 50 pages, I think.  It looks improved, versus my older machine.  This newer model has a fabulous paper path to make it easier to remove jams.**  You get many REMOTE PROGRAMMING options set from either the computer or directly on the machine, versus earlier Brother models.  You can operate the machine remotely, too;  call into it and 'poll' (receive its stored input).** You can FAX receive/send either directly from your computer, including broadcasting to groups, timed faxes, polling (get faxes from some distant machine, like IRS fax downloads).  The Brother offers many different resolutions and settings you can choose for printed fax clarity; by contrast, its internal PC-Fax function (faxing directly from your computer) is weirdly capped to 200x200 resolution.** You can SCAN to create files on your computer, of course.  Paperport manipulates the scanned pages afterwards (i.e., change page order, formats).  The 8480DN uses Paperport version 11.** COPYing, including with almost-too-many settings for 'cleaning' an original, reduction, enlargement, shrinking up to 4 pages into one page.  Many options in the dialogue boxes to help correct bad originals; the manuals offer good hints, too. Copy and print settings you change on the fly (i.e., lower row of charcoal square buttons) don't change your defaults;  they only change your next function.** NETWORK-capable, has its own Ethernet port.  Hook it up using either parallel or USB.  (I prefer parallel; keeps my USB ports free and less drain on the machine.)  Lots of security options; mind-boggling, how you can configure pinpointed security.** SIMULTANEITY, true MULTIFUNCTION: you can send/receive a fax, print, and scan to file all at the SAME time.  No special setting for this, it's automatic.  I've been in the middle of a scan when a fax came in; or, was printing, on my older 9700.  Or had left something scanned on the plate but scanned something else, with no mixup.  I still don't know why it works so well.  So that convenience continues in the newer 8480DN.** Need more MEMORY?  Simple:  buy and insert the added RAMM into the side of the machine as easily as you'd insert an SSD card into a slot of your netbook.  Default memory claims to support storage of 600 pages of scans (presumably text, not necessarily that high for photos).================================================Now to Tier #2, at this review's start: running the 8480 DN from the CONTROL CENTER.================================================After installation, you access Control Center 3 via subset of the MFC-8480 menu under 'Brother' menu/folder. Ignore its option to use the 'Modern' skin, stick instead to the turquoise default menu. Pick Device Settings, then Remote Setup.  There will be a pause, as the computer loads the settings resident in the machine.  These are fairly straight forward, except for some arcanely-named options, covered below.  As you work with them, remember to periodically hit the 'Apply' button, to save your work to the MFC while editing.  Click the OK button to save and exit.  The Remote Setup Dialogue box's 'tree' headers are:GENERAL:  the oddly-named 'Mode Timer' means the RESET time between the last function you did, and resumption of Fax Mode.  If you turn 'Mode Timer' off, you disable faxing. At times that's helpful, to avoid interruptions; generally you'd want the default of 2 minutes. The setting also controls how long you can repeat whatever you last did, too. So if you've a longish copy or print job, increase the Mode Timer or turn it 'off' to disable any reset to Fax Mode.--- Paper Type and Tray #1 (.5 ream) and MP Tray.  The former is the pull-out tray.  The other is a bypass tray, which they call 'MP'; its door is drop-down: light-gray door on the front of the machine (not the dark gray part for the drum and toner): see the paper manual's page 12.  So you can feed 1-3 sheets or envelopes at a time, via the bypass.  This becomes useful for mixed paper types in a print job, when you code the machine to pause at certain points.  You can also buy another .5 ream pullout tray to attach underneath the machine, for about $200 more.  (The tray integrates into the machine via screws supplied with the unit.)--- Default Paper Type is Plain (think 'copy paper' of Xerox quality, approx. 18-lb); but the 8480DN also accepts thin or thick paper.  The manuals give you great hints on how to tell what's thin or thick by paper behavior -- including envelopes, the #1 complaint users have about this machine -- so you waste less paper guessing. Envelopes are problemmatic in any laser printer;  the cheaper ones are usually the worst.  The thinner, the worse.  As for thick, 65-lb paper qualifies as 'thick' (stiff stock for title pages in presentation folders). Even 65-lb paper worked fine in my MFC 9700.--- Tray Use means where should the machine SEARCH for the paper to print.  Default is the bypass 'MP' tray first, then the pullout ('T1') tray.  Be sure to match the machine's settings to the size paper you use.  You have many sizes to choose, all the way up to legal.--- Glass Scan Size limits how far the scanner will scan on the plate.  So you match that to your actual paper size, as well, lest you get black/blank scan.--- File Size refers to compression if you're printing to a file:  use 'small' if you'll email.  Else, use the default for either Color or Grayscale, to file.  (Acrobat will give you the smallest file size.  Next best is Fujitsu S1500 scanner. This Brother might be as good.)FAX:  Setup Receive's Ring Delay should probably be set to 2, so the fax will pick up on the third ring. The Fax/Tele Ring Time of 30 seconds is usually best, as that's the usual 'handshaking' time between calling and answering faxes, especially if you attached an answering machine (aka 'TAD').  Don't use voicemail, because Ameritech or Comcast or will take the call, so your fax can't 'hear' it.  Attach an old-fashioned answering machine from 1990 or later.--- Setup Send is a little more arcane:  here you can set Batch or Real Time transmission off or on, whether a cover page and what kind, with preset or customized messages. (Frankly, it's easier to create your own cover page, unless you broadcast to many people.)  See pages 45-46 of the paper manual, for details.--- Address Book!  Yowsa: you can type in the numbers and names (they make Vcards), or you can import Outlook or Outlook Express 6 data to the MFC -- but not from HERE!  Oh no, they put the Address Book import option in Control Center 3's PC-Fax, 'Setup' option.  Then, select the 'AddressBook' tab and specify type and file path for your book.--- Report Setting gives you a valuable history log of faxes in and out. I set mine up to give me a weekly report, but you can select it by day, hour, or x # of faxes.  The 'Start At' means what hour, for time.  It might mean something else, if you pick a different option.--- Remote Fax Options:  these control how you want your fax to act, when you're away.  You can have it forward, be paged, have it store in the machine  (so you can retrieve it remotely, which Brother calls 'polling'); or, have it store in your computer.--- Dial Restrictions is a kind of quick password protection, to prevent others or yourself from dialing wrongly.COPY:  You'd adjust these settings for higher than normal resolution. Increase Contrast if copying pencil;  increase brightness if the original is old or discolored.  The manuals here offer helpful hints on how to clean up your originals (esp. what Brother calls 'noise').  So too, the dialogue boxes; play with the settings.  Very nice and rare features.PRINT: to duplex or not duplex, that is the longevity question. In the 'Automatic duplex Printing' section of the onscreen User's Guide  -- it says 'DO NOT use bond paper' for duplex, with good reason.  I'd argue never to use duplex at all, unless you want to shorten the life of your machine, and spend extra money at least once a year to have some professional clean your machine's innards.=====>  GRATUITOUS TREEHUGGING MESSAGE:  If you want to save a tree, go paperless.  If you want to see your printed paper become brittle faster, go duplex.  Its value is way overrated.  Great for book printing, but again you'll just dirty your machine twice as fast, i.e., 100 pages duplexed 50, will dirty twice as fast as 100 pages simplex, for the toner goes on BOTH sides of the rollers.  It's a false economy, and you can always reuse paper on only one side, for scrap...DIRECT PRINT: makes the MFC print directly from your pen drive or plugged-in camera, without the computer.  Here, you can shrink up to 25 pages onto one, in multiple formats.  Could be useful if the computer is off or tied up.SCAN to USB: means you can scan directly to a pen drive, too, bypassing the computer.NETWORK options are fairly straightforward.  Remember that UTC is almost equal to GMC, for the time zone.INITIAL SETUP:  Check the 'PC Clock' box.  Quirk in the machine will keep on unchecking that box, after you save.  That's probably why when you turn off the machine, it forgets the time.  But hey:  my beloved MFC 9700 didn't even have a power button.  The machines are meant to stay on, ever vigilant for faxes.Here you must experiment, with 'Dial Tone'.  Sometimes setting it to Detection creates glitches;  sometimes not.  The 'Dial Prefix' should be '1' (just as for your Fax and Tel numbers), if your stored phone numbers don't have that prefix, or you otherwise have a direct line out.  If you have to dial some prefix to get an outside line, put that in front.  Since the 8480DN is hooked up to the PC, check 'from PC Clock' for the source of the machine's time, especially if you often have power outages.  Finally, if you set the machine to 'manual' fax receipt, then you must type a code, to activate the fax.  You set the code in the Setup Receive option under FAX.Whew!  You're 10% done!  Now let's talk about the other turquoise ControlCenter3 entries above 'Device Settings'.  These, too, don't operate as you'd expect.SCAN: if you left-click, you tell Brother to scan something IMMEDIATELY on the scanning glass, for any of the four items listed.  They are DESTINATIONS for your scanning, so you must program them first.  So you RIGHT click, to configure settings. Next, you'll see a tabbed dialogue box.  Its 'Software Button' is a preset you configure for scanning directly into an application, but USING YOUR COMPUTER.  By contrast, the 'Device Button' is a preset for the SCAN BUTTON on the 8480DN.  So, you have one 'pair' per Image, OCR, Email and File. Thus you can have up to eight presets.  If that much flexibility makes your head spin, set both Software and Device button options exactly alike, so you can use the computer OR the button on the machine, to get the same result.  Repeat: the buttons are DESTINATION-oriented, so you have up to eight destinations, two per type of scan, you can choose.  And you choose, the application DESTINATION for the scan; the File Type, resolution and scan type, paper size.  Also, click 'Scanner Interface' if you plan to crop the image after scanning, or otherwise edit it.  If an application you want to use isn't in the drop-down list and you know the path of the application you want to use, then click the 'Add' button and then click on the folder icon, to browse for that program's location.  Suggest you add MSPScan.exe which is Microsoft's own Document scanning program.  Sometimes it's faster; and like Paperport, offers post-scan file manipulation.=====> SUGGESTION:  pick the highest resolution and quality settings for IMAGE and OCR and FILE; but for EMAIL pick the lowest settings you can stomach.  For your average email ISP services like AOL, Verizon, etc. allow only 5MB for attachments.  So too, the IRS and other Government agencies provide their employees with very limited storage, capping email attachments to about 5MB per email.  (Note: gmail and Yahoo have much higher caps, like 20-30MB per email.)CUSTOM SCAN: this is the same as scan, except that you get to change the icon names, too.  Another 8 configuration options, for Software and Device Buttons.Whew! Now you're 50% done!  Could they make it more complicated?COPY: Here you get four added presets for Copying, when you right-click.  You can even specify different printers, whether to scale (fit) the text to the size of the output page, and other options.  Since it's usually easier to change common copy settings on the machine, these four are best reserved for very special jobs, with maybe 60 suboptions.  Give the presets names which will make you instantly remember what they do.PC-FAX:  Max resolution is 400x 400, in this model;  but if you plan to do delayed or batch/broadcasted (to many people) faxes, PC-Fax can be helpful (see pages 45-46 of the paper manual).  Again, you right click the Send icon to configure it to send faxes directly from your computer, rather than print out and then feed the machine.  Presumably the Send icon setting controls Receive, too, as you can't configure that one's resolution from the computer;  you CAN configure it from the machine, see the paper manual on Setup Receive.Back to the Control Center configuration: If you make a mistake and hit its Receive icon more than once, you get the PaperPort menu, so have to quit and REBOOT, to reset the icon.  So instead, hit the Setup icon. Finally, here you get a sensible dialogue box.  The 'Address Book' tab is most helpful: you can load your Outlook or Outlook Express addresses and phones into the Brother.  Suggest you first complete your Outlook/Express data before you import.  Finally, the Speed Dial tab allows you to configure a special 10 speed dial from your computer.  These will not be the same as what you programmed back in the Device Settings, Remote Fax Setup 'Address Book'. Presumably those latter, match the speed-dial numbers on the machine, up to 34.  (By the way, when you use Speed Dial, the too-white menu on the machine will light up with the name associated with that speed dial number, so you get to SEE the speed dial name, before sending.)Back in the 'Speed Dial' tab of PC-Fax Setup: to configure the special 10, you must manually 'add' the name on the left, to a number on the right.  Again, you can only dial these from your PC.Whew, 70% done!  Are you groaning, yet?================================Now to Tier #3, using Paperport to run your 8480DN.=================================Paperport is a scanner controller plus sorter and converter; it works like moving papers on your desk, into finished bundles.  Paperport has distinct scanner control advantages versus direct machine or Control Center.  You access Paperport from the ScanSoft Paper Port menu item (or programs).  Most importantly, it can make duplex scans.  Here's how: access Paperport, select duplex, and you'll get a cute dialogue box telling you how to do it.  Additionally, you can specify whether you want to scan in TWAIN or WIA mode, an option not selectible (so far as I can tell), via Tier #1 direct on-machine or #2 Control Center operating modes.  It might not work in XP, or maybe it only works with Twain.  I've not yet tested it, just going by its instructions, en ce moment.  Will report back here with the results.Again, Paperport is fairly basic, intuitive.  It has has many fans, and three chief advantages:  a) it's organized like a desktop, so you can arrange stuff on it, move that stuff around into stacks or unstack;  just like shuffling papers into or out of stacks, on your desk.  So, scan of 50 unrelated pages; and then move each of those pages into other stacks, be they photos, charts, whatever.  Then b) you can scan while in Paperport, to add more stuff to reassemble.  Then c) you can export your stacks into a variety of applications which are iconized at the bottom of the screen: like Outlook Express, Excel, Word, pdf, etc.  Paperport is Win7 compatible, so will show compatible apps.  You get these same features with Fujitsu Scan Snap S1500, Adobe Acrobat, and many Acrobat knock offs, my favorite being Smart PDF Creator Pro.  They all work better at arranging and converting, vs. MS or WordPerfect Office.Limited tagging and editing, in Paperport.  I couldn't see any options, but I'm sure there are some.==================================MAINTENANCE==================================This machine requires very little upkeep.  A bit of Windex on the plate once a week or month, depending on how often you scan;  feather-dust everything else, especially the interiors, once a month or more often;  I actually use a turkey feather bought in a craft shop (you know, for kids wanting to play Indian chief at Halloween).  I use it also to clean between my keyboard crevices.  Handy thing.RUN CLEANER SHEETS after a major print job which is dense (200+ pages), else once a week (you can buy these in Amazon).  You can use each of these sheets five or ten times and still get cleaning from them.  They are impregnated with a substance which catches toner and DUST.  Those are the two killers of good output, and if you don't do it, you ask for trouble.  Think of it as the equivalent of not defragging your hard drive.  If you don't defrag once a week, your machine will slow to a crawl.  The sheets prevent that BLACK LINE you so often see in unkempt faxes.  Toner is a kind of dust; it's so fine, that by the time you see little black spots, it's almost too late.  GET THE CLEANING SHEETS.  Any printer needs this.I like those lint-free old flour towels our mothers used to have, for cleaning the plate.  Got any old makeup brushes?  Clean them and use them to dust inside the ADF, especially the rollers.  DO NOT use solvent on the rollers, unless you like a dysfunctional machine.  At most, use a dampened sheet which has no lint (better still, just a soft blush brush which is VERY clean).  Dirty ADFs are a major cause of jams.  Takes a few minutes while on a phone call or watching something on TV.  Once a week.CONSUMABLES:  I think the Brother toner runs about $70, and it lasts a long time.  They say 3,000 pages, but I've gotten a lot more than that.  I still keep the old toners, in case I suddenly need one.  Shake it from side to side maybe once a month or two, to make it last longer.  The toner problem isn't so much that it runs out, but that it sticks to the sides.  When the print quality looks bad, the toner cartridge needs a little rocking from side to side.  Do it over the sink, unless you have black carpets.The drum unit is maybe $100-120, and it too has a much longer life than Brother recommends.  Though, they tell you to ignore the CHANGE DRUM SOON warning until you see degradation you can't tolerate. My old MFC 9700 h\""

The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent \\'prayer of the bone\" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don\\'t get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It\\'s just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.  Lets hope this show continues on for many years to come.']\n",
            " ['I discovered this series quite by accident. Having watched and appreciated Masterpiece Contemporary: Place of Execution, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written, and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the \"cozy\" mysteries such as the long-running Midsomer Murders - Set One and The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, sometimes involving children, almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.The first season contains three main stories, each divided into two episodes:The Mermaids Singing - Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.Shadows Rising - The skeletal remains of a young woman is found, and when further evidence turns up, DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands, one with a penchant for dark-haired young women.Justice Painted Blind - Another unsettling case, this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. This throws up a whole bunch of suspects, including the parents of the murdered girl.The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.The streaming was good overall with only a little delayed streaming during Episode One. There were no glitches on the other episodes. The picture quality could be improved though as it did seem a bit grainy to me.']\n",

You need an affinity for quirky, offbeat humor to enjoy it, not to mention a high tolerance for raw language and sexual humor.  The first season consisted of just seven episodes, but established the core characters and operators of Paddy&#8217;s Pub; owners Dennis, Mac, and Charlie, and waitress/Dennis&#8217;s twin sister Dee.  In Season 2 (ten episodes), Danny Devito comes on board as Frank, Dennis and Dee&#8217;s dad.  The show&#8217;s creators (Rob McElhenney/ Mac; Glenn Howerton/Dennis; and Charlie Day/Charlie) are hilarious as actors, and also as writers.  Every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me.  It&#8217;s one of those great ensemble casts that&#8217;s incredibly balanced in terms of the personalities and comedic nature of each character, resulting in a consistently high level of quality in every episode.  These first two seasons have some of my favorites, including &#8220;Charlie Has Cancer,&#8221; &#8220;Charlie Got Molested,&#8221; &#8220;Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,&#8221; &#8220;Hundred Dollar Baby,&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody&#8217;s Ass.&#8221;  Like most fans of the show, I tend to favor the Charlie-themed episodes, and considering that he&#8217;s the only one so far to get movie roles and a gig hosting SNL, it&#8217;s clear how important he is as part of the cast.  But that&#8217;s not a knock against anyone else.  I can&#8217;t really imagine it continuing if they lost any of the key characters of Dennis, Dee, Mac, and Charlie, and even though Frank wasn't there in the beginning, it would definitley hurt the show to lose him.

At things that aren't supposed to be funny, but as any serious fan of comedy knows, those can be the best laughs. I walked away feeling lighter and happier. If that ain't comedic success, what is?IASIP is like Seinfeld if the SeinFour were ten years younger, Irish, and ran a bar in South Philly. These guys have clearly studied Sein and Curb very closely, and their tight timing and topics and banter are all very Larry Davidesque...but they go places even LD won't. The best two shows of the 7-episode first season are about cancer and abortion; I howled at some moments. These guys have done what so many guys want to do: make a show about how funny they are. Except, these guys really are funny. Sometimes. But hey, no one's always hittin' homers, even on comedy 'roids, so I cut these three some slack and marvel at how tightly they work together. There's a lot to be said for working with old friends, if they have talent: the camaraderie and timing here are born of many years of drinking and laughing and thinking and falling down, no doubt. And these three guys are each pretty dang funny, each in his own fashion.DeVito is ok but I liked the first season best for its rawness. Still, as the later shows get a little more polished it's often in good ways.If you don't like drinking, if you insist on PC language from your friends and neighbors, and if you are in general just plain uptight about people living and thinking the way you want them to, look elsewhere. But If you enjoy tying one on and laughing your butt off at the endlessly silly idiocy that accompanies being alive in America these days, you may just find Always Sunny to be almost always funny.\"]\n",

They get into all kinds of crazy hijinks through misunderstandings and just plain bad judgement, ranging from being mistaken as a gay bar to Charlie lying about having cancer.

            " [\"For sheer intensity and plot topsy-turvies, no other show comes close to 24. You'd think the premise (every hour of the 24 episode-long season is played in real-time; thus 24 encapsulates a full day) would get old by now, but, surprisingly, the producers and writers have managed to come up with another riveting, must-see season. In fact, this might be the best season of them all. The thrills and nail-biting suspense (as well as the SPOILERS alert) begin early in the season five opener, with the shocking slaying of President Palmer and assassination attempts on familiar CTU agents (one of which is tragically successful). Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is lured out of hiding after 18 months and becomes rapidly embroiled in a devious conspiracy that goes all the way up to the White House. As he becomes the most wanted man in America (he is framed for Palmer's assassination), he must try to ferret out the true culprit(s) and again save the country from deadly Russian extremists and various domestic villains. On a personal level, he must come to terms with the deaths of personal friends, the alienation of his daughter Kim, and the fact that his former girlfriend  Audrey Raines (Kim Raver) might have moved on.There's a reason why Kiefer won the best dramatic actor Emmy and why 24 beat out the likes of the West Wing, the Sopranos, Grey's Anatomy, and House for best drama. The fifth season is fully serviced by a coming together of story and acting - from the gripping, edge-of-your-seat plot line, with its manic twists and turns, to the no-quarters-given, full speed ahead performances of the cast, but specially of Kiefer Sutherland, who gives his all in inhabiting his role. Kiefer IS the show and consistently produces such driven intensity, lying just beneath an icy cold surface, and yet his eyes reveal a vulnerability of sorts, when he's reacting to something personal to him. He makes a scene work, even without dialogue. Very good stuff. And, no, you do not want to get in the way of Jack Bauer.There are other standouts, of course. Gregory Itzin as the shifty and weak-willed U.S. President makes you gleefully hiss, while Jean Smart as the medicated First Lady Martha Logan brings earnest soap-opera acting to primetime. Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe O'Brian) continues her highlight role as CTU's brilliant but cantankerous and socially-inept tech support operative. Meanwhile, James Morrison, Roger Cross, Kim Raver, Carlos Bernard, Louis Lombardi, and Sean Astin become the season's dependable, solid bedrock.That so many of the regular cast die in this season lends an immediacy to the episodes and exponentially raises the stakes. There's no comfort level at all here, as you're never sure who would survive in the end (but, with this show, were you ever sure?). Even Kiefer Sutherland had played around with the idea of having Jack Bauer biting the dust (Please, no!).So, the 24 - Season Five dvd box releases December 5, 2006, just in time for you to go thru 'em to prep for season six, which begins next January on Fox. Season Six, by the way, picks up nearly two years after season five's finale and will have James Cromwell with a recurring role as Jack's estranged dad, Phillip Bauer. Also joining the cast is Eddie Izzard, Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle), Peter MacNicol, Regina King, and the beautiful Rena Sofer. I can't wait to own season five and, then, to see season six. Long live Jack Bauer!\"]\n",
            " ['Revel in his awesomeness!!! For he is a god amongst men and he is deserving of all praise that can possibly be heaped upon him. The one time the Emmys got something right!! Jack Bauer is as close as any fictional character has become to being superhumanly powerful, and at some times his recurrent circumvention of the bureaucratic system, assaulting his friends and co-workers, his flagrant abuse of \"prisoner\\'s rights\" and his uncanny ability to fight his way out of any trap... it may require a little bit more suspension of disbelief than would normally be necessary in a lesser show, but the very core of this show is Jack Bauer, or more specifially, Kiefer Sutherland and his increasingly better performance each season of 24. When he is having a particularly emotional moment, you feel it exude from the screen.... this is just an example of the power that Sutherland brings to this show. Also standing out as always is Mary Lynn Rasjkub as the wonderfully ascerbic and wicked-tongued Chloe O\\'Brien. The introduction of her character is one of the best things that\\'s happened to this show. But this season has some other stand-out characters: one that was introduced in season 4 and a brand new one. Fans of the show know these as President Charles Logan (the wonderfully slimy Gregory Itzin) and his first lady Martha Logan (the amazing Jean Smart). Their interplay and their performances are almost as key as Sutherland in this season. Another thing that came to be almost an in-joke is that three members of the cast of the original ROBOCOP film appear in different parts of the series, which as a fan of that film was just really cool to see. Whether or not that was intended, it\\'s still a nice touch for genre fans. Julian Sands has lots of fun chewing up scenery as the evil Russian-yet-English-Accented Terrorist. The premise is per usual: Jack must defy all odds to save the country and avenge his personal losses. But the plot itself is of a higher level of complexity and tragedy this season than prior seasons. The way it begins is ALMOST as shocking as the way the season ends. And the ending of the final episode of the season... that scream you heard in the whole of the United States and parts of Canada and Mexico... that was me. January 2007 CANNOT GET HERE SOON ENOUGH!!!']\n",
            " [\"The first five seasons of 24 are the best thriller/escapism you'll find on television. It's fast-paced, big-budgeted, over-the-top (sometimes WAAAAAAAY over-the-top), and mostly clever. But I don't think ANY of the previous seasons (or the lame season 6) can come even close to the excitment and joy of watching this fifth season.Yes this season follows the same (tired) gimick of everything happening in real-time, but what set this season apart for me was it's more focusd plot-line. Several of lead character Jack Bauer's friends are killed or attacked and he's out to find out who and get revenge. Ok, sometimes the overall story arch DOES get side-tracked to the typical (terrorists trying to release poisonous gas), and sometimes it's not always that interesting (CTU gets infiltrated AGAIN!). But none of these side-attractions even BEGIN to take-away from the exciting central story which pushes along at break-neck speed and crediblilty (thanks also to the believable performances of the ENTIRE cast).Like some people I try not to watch the show on TV and much prefer to wait for the DVD to come out which is why I can't recommend buying this season enough (thought why there's not subtitles on every episode is beyond me). Yes it's a couple years old now, but it's still the best (and most affordable) 24 episodes of action you'll find anywhere.\"]\n",

He has been working hard to iron out an anti-terrorism treaty with Russia, and that treaty will be signed that day.  But the treat of terrorists in Los Angeles with stolen nerve gas just might be enough to derail the treaty.Season 5 won an Emmy for best drama, and it was well deserved.  Even after five years, this show is gripping drama with excellent writing and acting.  I am glued to my seat every week, breathing only during commercial breaks.  This season the threat and storytelling seemed more focused then previous years, adding to the drama.There were a couple flaws this season.  I sure don't remember the explanation of who knew Jack was alive at the beginning of the season.  Maybe it was mentioned and I missed it.  Furthermore, we have yet more examples of lack of security at CTU.  While it does make for gripping drama, it does seem like they could come up with a new plot trick every so often.My biggest complaint this season was the body count.  We lost several key characters from previous years.  While I understand the producer's desire to keep us on the edge of our seats, can't anyone from the show live happily ever after?  It honestly got to the point I dreaded seeing anyone who had been on the show before for fear they would be killed off.Still, these are minor issues with a truly wonderful show.

It starts strong and doesn\\'t let up until it\\'s over.As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. Season 5, however, breaks from this tradition and instead packages the discs in 4 slim cases (the 4th holds the bonus features disc). A change of page in packaging, but still quite attractive, with approximately the same shelf footprint (if not slightly smaller).Season 5 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and bonus features. I might note however, they\\'ve added a slightly longer intro before getting to the main menu (looks like booting up and logging into a CTU computer system). However, on my DVD player I could skip ahead without having to play the whole sequence. So, it wasn\\'t completely ungainly.The video and audio were up to par. Of course I don\\'t have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can\\'t test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn\\'t notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I\\'ve noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn\\'t say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn\\'t seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you\\'ll probably like 24 as well. There are some \"intense\" scenes and probably some harsh language, so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters, if at all.']\n",

There is, however, a big plot hole in the season.  The fate of Evelyn Martin and her daughter was never covered, and I found that unfair; an entire episode depicted their plight, and I feel it should have been resolved, whether she was killed or left alive by Henderson.Any show that can make a person sympathize with someone while viciously rooting against them (i.e. Logan) is a stupendous show.  24 delivers all of that and more, with its best season to date.9/10\"]\n",

The fifth season of \"24\" revolves around one central mystery: who killed an ex-president and how is Jack Bauer connected to the assassination? It\\'s a thrilling season--probably the best since the first season--and it comes to a stunning conclusion that will be answered in January of 2007. Interestingly after having watched \"Casino Royale\" its clear that the new Bond film was inspired by shows like \"24\" which were, in turn, inspired by early Bond and some of the newer spy thrillers out there. There are a number of twists and turns in this season set my advice is NOT to read any reviews that summarize anymore of the plot if you haven\\'t seen this season as there are some major spoilers in some of the reviews that follow.As usual Fox has put together a terrific DVD. This also features a brief episode \"prequel\" to the sixth season like previous sets had. We get a large amount of worthwhile commentary tracks including some with Emmy winner Kiefer Sutherland. There\\'s also a summary of the season included as well athough if you\\'ve watched the show (or are watching it now) it won\\'t really provide anything new. Th \"100 Episode Reel\" is a pretty useless extra -- basically a clips compilation.Different places are offering different exclusives. If you purchase it here you can download a free episode from Unbox (at least during the Holidays) while Target also offers a limited edition bonus disc for this set with additional featurettes on the show. Regardless of whether you buy it here at amazon.com or elsewhere this set features plenty of extras including an examination of the wonderful Presidential retreat featured in the show, a good featurette on the stellar work by the cinematography on the show, a featurette on the supporting actors on the show as well as extended and deleted scenes. I haven\\'t had a chance to dig through all the bonus material yet but it what I have checked out looks really, really good.This set is packaged in the thinpak holders with two discs per holder so the accordian style packaging has been abandoned for this thinner packaging.

            " ['While Season One of 24 focused much of its attention on President David Palmer, Seasons 2-4 saw the Oval Office by and large take a back seat to the missions of Jack Bauer and CTU.  However, Season Five brings some of the attention back to the sitting U.S. President (this time Charles Logan) and ends up with a much more well-rounded storyline.For a basic (non-spoilery) plot summary, a group of Russian terrorists threaten to release canisters of nerve gas in the U.S., leading Bauer to be reprieved from his thought-to-be death in order to help stop the crisis.  As CTU begins investigating the terrorism, however, it quickly becomes clear that the terrorists are working with a high-ranking government official, and the conspiracy begins to be unraveled.To be honest, at first I was skeptical of all the focus on President Logan, as didn\\'t like his character and wasn\\'t sure that he could command the camera as well as his predecessor Palmer.  However, by the end of the season, Logan is easily the most enjoyable/interesting character on the show.  His acting, along with his wife, chief of staff, and head of security, really gives the show the Presidential presence it lacked since that first season.Of course, there is still more than enough of Jack Bauer and his fellow CTU agents (Audrey Rains, Bill Buchanon, Edgar Stiles, Chloe O\\'Brien, etc.) to go around, which means that intense drama ensues in every single episode.  The writers have an amazing way to take a character that looks like a creep (think Tony Almeida and George Mason in the early seasons) and, by the end of a few episodes, have him become a noble hero, and that tradition continues in this season as well.The only \"knock\" I have on this season is that the cliffhanger endings of each episodes aren\\'t quite as shocking (e.g. Nina Myers doesn\\'t appear out of nowhere).  However, I think that was more of a creative choice by the writers, as the story is actually more coherent that any season besides the first one.  Instead of seemingly changing the plot of the show with every episode, Season Five slowly crescendos until the big finale.So, fans of 24 can purchase this season with confidence knowing that they will still get their action, drama, suspense, and some great twists and turns along the way.']\n",

I love all the characters in the show-Abby, Ducky, Dinozo(sp), \"Probie\", Ziva and the like.  As each of them has their various moments throughout the season from killing an undercover cop, to a prisoner dying in custody or a mentally deranged ex-boyfriend that just won\\'t go away.Along with some cool special features, NCIS is a show that is best watched from the beginning so that you get the full effect.  So buy the 1st seasons and start from there.  By the time you get to season 3 you\\'ll be well versed and know what all the buzz is about.  NCIS is the real deal when it comes to TV shows period.']\n",
            " ['It is a well-done TV series that can absorb cast changes and continue to deliver excellent shows.  NCIS Season Two ended with the shocking murder of Agent Caitlin Todd.  Season Three opens with two major cast additions.  Cote de Pablo joins the team as the beautiful and dangerous Israeli Mossad Agent Ziva David, while veteran actress Lauren Holly, as Jenny Shepard, becomes the new director of NCIS.The changes put iconic Senior Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) in the awkward situation of working in a new agent while getting used to a new boss who is a former love interest.  The rest of the team, still grieving for Caitlin, are slow to embrace Ziva but will be won over by her obvious competence, and by her hilarious efforts to master American slang.  Wisecracking Agent Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly)in particular will find that Ziva forces him to raise his game in a way that Caitlin never quite did.The exciting two-part season opener resolves the still-open case of Agent Todd\\'s murder.  A two-part season ender places Gibbs\\' service with NCIS at risk.  The audience will learn more about Gibbs\\' past while contemplating another season-ending cliff-hanger.  In between, the team will handle serial killers, terrorists, and kidnappings with its usual mixture of brisk police procedural and entertaining repartee.  Six special features about the making of the show are included in the DVD set.  \"NCIS: The Third Season\" is very highly recommended to fans of the series.']\n",

            " ['It was rough enough for the fans of NCIS to lose Kate Todd by having Ari Haswari snipe her at the end of Season 2.  So, starting Season 3 off by showing Kate\\'s murder from Ari\\'s POV is a little rougher.  But the two episodes that start off Season 3 of NCIS--the two part \"Kill Ari\" episodes--really bring up a subject in this series that hadn\\'t been fully fleshed out.  Obviously, these two episodes allow the regular characters to come to grips with the loss of Kate--the irony of Kate\\'s ghost talking to Ducky and Ducky not talking back to the ghost, the overall story of how the survivors all see Kate.  McGee seeing a superwoman, Abby seeing Elvira, Tony being Tony in seeing Kate (That schoolgirl outfit), and Gibbs seeing Kate as he last saw her--with a hole between her eyes.  Just as obviously, \"Kill Ari\" allows for the introduction of Cote De Pablo\\'s Ziva David, the Mossad/Masada agent liased to NCIS in the wake of Kate\\'s death and Lauren Holly\\'s Jenny Sheppard--Gibbs\\' former partner/lover who rose beyond working the field to the NCIS director\\'s job.But my observation after a couple of viewings of this box set is that the underlying story of the season is the revelations about the history of Leroy Jethro Gibbs.  For much of the first two seasons, Mark Harmon\\'s \"tough, no-nonsense investigator\" (To quote the liner notes on the set) has always had an understated sense of humor that has allowed him to smile quitely at the office interaction between the members of the team while presenting his harder face.  But that exterior begins to crack in the \"Kill Ari\" episodes; the mystery surrounding Jethro\\'s background begins to unfold as Ari murders Kate, then takes his shot at Abby and captures Dr. Mallard.  This is what starts leading Jethro to being close to Ziva--maybe no one notices, but because of the information that she uncovered about Jethro and fed to her half-brother Ari, Officer David feels partially responsible for Kate\\'s murder.Through Season 3, we start getting clues to who Jethro is and what he keeps from everyone--the flask that we see at the end of \"Under Covers\", his continued attraction towards redheads (It certainly is no coincidence that Holly/Sheppard is a redhead), and the subtleties of his relationship with Ziva--forged in an oddly shared tragedy.  Of course, much of all that goes on in the season comes to a head in the \"Hiatus\" two-parter at the end of the season.  We find out why Gibbs is what he is, how many of his actions have prepared DiNozzo for running the team and prepped Tim for being an agent; and how the discoveries affect his relationship with Dr. Mallard and Director Sheppard.As always since this series started, the performances are stunning.  Mark Harmon continues to embody the toughness and instincts of Jethro, but also had to be very nuanced as Gibbs\\' painful history comes out.Michael Weatherly\\'s Tony DiNozzo continued being the second coming of David Addison (my usual Moonlighting aside), but Tony had to face growing up and being a decision-maker/leader (\"Bait\"), and had a difficulty through this season that he hadn\\'t had in the previous two--ZIVA.Cote De Pablo flipped the dynamic of the team.  As Ziva, Cote brought a much more formidable presence to the squad.  In the first two seasons, Tony could get Kate off-balance with his remarks and his stunts, offending her Catholic schoolgirl sensibilities.  In the third season, Ziva--partially because of her background, partially because it was just HER--was able to get Tony off his feed more than he thought possible.  An example of this--aside from her driving, or her mangling of slang--came up in \"Probie\", when she was able to get Tony to reveal why he was receiving calls from a sperm bank.  De Pablo was able to affect a very cool and very canny customer in Ziva.  Many viewers are always going to miss Sasha Alexander, but Cote is a wonderful fit.Sean Murray\\'s Tim McGee is still a wonderful work in progress; the nerd-boy field agent who continues to get tortured by DiNozzo in a big-brother/little-brother fashion.  He still seems over his head at times, eager to please Gibbs (Or at least keep Jethro from popping him one in the back of the head--isn\\'t it funny how The Head Slap has become one of the show\\'s many trademarks?).  Plus, there\\'s whatever seems to be going on in his private life, whether or not it\\'s with Abby.Of course, what can be said about Pauley?  Perrette is a scene-stealing wonder on screen, especially in Abby\\'s lab when she\\'s mainlining the \"Kaff-Pow\" or getting Bert to do what he does (Her stuffed hippo--YEAH, THAT ONE).  Plus, we get surprised by Abby\\'s ability with duct tape (\"Frame Up\") and her temper in general (\"Bloodbath\").David McCallum\\'s Dr. Mallard continues to be the second coming of Jonathan Quayle Higgins, though not as prissy as Robin Masters\\' major domo.  Ducky continues to tell his stories while working his was through the cadavers.  Plus, we get another visit from Nina Foch as Ducky\\'s mom late in the season, getting a surreal moment when she\\'s visiting the NCIS HQ.Many people thought the introduction of Jenny Sheppard as fluff.  Given the underlying story of the season, Lauren Holly\\'s character was actually needed.  Jenny became an insight to Gibbs\\' relationship issues and why he stays operating as an investigator--basically, she knows certain things about Jethro that his squad aren\\'t privvy to--though as it turns out, she doesn\\'t know the whole story (Until \"Hiatus\").The good guest shots in this set have to start with Sasha Alexander, and her completion of the Catlin Todd storyline.  Her ghost appearing in various forms to the team members was striking (Of course, her schoolgirl outfit in Tony\\'s vision was typical Tony).  Rudolf Martin\\'s Ari Haswari was brilliant--slick, dangerous, deceptive and unstable.  I found myself regretting Ari\\'s storyline being completed--he could have been Wo Fat to Gibbs\\' McGarrett (Hawaii Five-O reference).  It\\'s always fun when Jessica Steen drops in to trade remarks with Weatherly as Paula Cassidy.  Michael Bellisario\\'s turn as Abby\\'s lab assistant is a comical and dangerous turn.  Finally, we can\\'t forget Muse Watson\\'s introduction in the \"Hiatus\" episodes as Gibbs\\' mentor when he joined NIS, Mike Franks.  Franks\\' amusement at the changes--the female director in particular--are tempered by his having to fill in many of the blanks for Gibbs when Jethro is recovering from amnesia.Ultimately, the season of change that is NCIS Season 3 is a storytelling wonder--full of the humor and action that has been the staple of the series since it\\'s beginning, but also the undercurrent of melancholy that permeates this season.  The loss of Kate really becomes the latest in a series of painful losses for Gibbs--but we never realize it until the end of the season.']\n",

After ten years, this video is a very interesting look at the past, and the promises vs. the reality of what became of the Big Dig project.Ironically, or perhaps prophetically, the film begins by showing a section of new tunnel (at time = 2:06). This is the EXACT LOCATION where (on July 10, 2006) the ceiling collapsed on a car, killing passenger Milena Del Valle. The heavy concrete panels were glued in place with epoxy cement that had not been applied properly. It was ultimately determined that ceiling panels weren\\'t actually needed in that location, so today, the ceiling that appears in the video is no longer there.Such was the theme for most of the Big Dig\\'s design and construction. Too many things were \"never attempted before\",  \"biggest in the world\", \"cutting edge\", and/or other custom-designed or unproven technologies. At the same time, the well-connected engineering and construction contractors deliberately made things more complicated and expensive than necessary, so as to maximize their own profits. One notorious example of this became known as the \"Ginzu Guardrails\". Instead of using industry-standard round pipe hand rails in the tunnels, an engineering contractor ordered custom-designed stainless steel hand rails with sharp vertical edges. Besides being much more expensive, they earned the \"Ginzu\" moniker for their ability to slice through accident victims like a knife! Today, many of the original hand rails have been destroyed in accidents and have not been replaced; other sections have been deliberately removed because they are too dangerous. As was the case for the section of ceiling that collapsed, these hand rails were not really needed at all.Of course, it\\'s not all bad; the I-90 extension to the airport has been a great improvement. The Ted Williams tunnel (a.k.a. the Frozen Head tunnel) was one of the first sections to open and the quality of construction is much better than all of the other tunnel sections that were built later. Unfortunately, most of the tunnels under Boston were built very poorly and most disturbingly of all, were not properly sealed to be watertight. In the winter, the leaking water forms huge icicles and ice patches that require application of large amounts of salt inside the tunnels. The large volume of water; combined with the freeze-thaw cycles and corrosive salt effect; was not something the tunnels were designed for. Consequently, the concrete and steel in the tunnels is deteriorating much more rapidly than expected. In another ill-advised design, the aluminum tunnel ceiling light fixtures were attached with steel brackets. Two dissimilar metals in a moist, corrosive environment are always doomed to corrode, and sure enough, in February 2011 the fixtures began falling into the roadway. (they\\'re now temporarily held in place with plastic tie straps, but must all be replaced) As if the initial construction cost wasn\\'t bad enough, the ongoing maintenance costs of the Big Dig will only get worse as the shoddily constructed sections continue to fall apart.I could go on and on about so many other things, but the bottom line is that the cost of the Big Dig was way more expensive than expected and way more expensive than necessary. So much money was spent on this one project, that there was nothing left for other highway projects in Massachusetts, or for the mass transit projects that were initially promised as mitigation for the environmental effects. For most drivers in Boston, the traffic is just as bad if not worse, but instead of being stuck in traffic on Boston\\'s old elevated Central Artery where at least you had a nice view, now you\\'re stuck in traffic in ugly, filthy, crumbling tunnels.The film ends with another ironic quote at time = 33:03 - \"Nobody in five years or ten years is gonna remember the cost, they\\'re gonna look at this thing and say: \\'what a beautiful job\\' \".It would be laughable, if it weren\\'t so very sad.Note for road geeks: Time = 24:05 has a very old aerial view of the Charles River crossing, showing the original elevated ramps that connected the Upper/Lower deck to the Tobin Bridge. Time = 24:42 shows the City Square tunnel under construction in Charlestown, before the loop ramps and Leverett Connector bridge were built.']\n",

            " ['Warning!  Many spoilers!Additional Warning:  Thanks to Canadian and British television, the final episodes of STARGATE SG-1 have already been shown through much of the world.  The following review is based on having seen everything including the series finale.And so after an amazing ten year run, STARGATE SG-1 comes to a dignified end.  Sorta.  Plans for a couple of TV movies are already in the works, so the plot ends that are left somewhat open at the end of the series will probably be resolved at that time.  It is hard at this point to know what the show\\'s legacy will be.  It never received the critical acclaim that series like FARSCAPE, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, FIREFLY, or even BABYLON 5 received, and one can\\'t point to specific ways that it has altered or molded other Sci-Fi series, but simply being around for a decade is unprecedented in Sci-fi.  Yeah, DR. WHO has been around longer, but its presence has been far more episodic and it has sometimes been prey to a budget smaller than a kids\\' show (though certainly this is not the case for its present incarnation).  It certainly did a number of things right.  The writing remained strong throughout.  The production values were strong from beginning to end.  And if it never scaled the peaks of brilliance of other series it still managed to produce many memorable moments.  Perhaps its legacy is something to be set aside for a decade or so.What is amazing is that the tenth season was a largely successful effort at self-recreation.  Season Nine had been plagued by pregnancy.  Both Amanda Tapping and Claudia Black (and some of the outfits Ms. Black wore in Season Ten reveal that she has fully recovered from having given birth--the highlight of Season Ten might have been the outfit she wore in the high school reunion episode from near the end of the season) had children during that season.  I\\'m a huge fan of kids and having babies, but it doesn\\'t mesh well with making TV shows.  Tapping was missing for the early part of the season and Black for most of the middle.  Both were present for the entirety of Season Ten.  Black\\'s real life pregnancy fed into the plot of Season Ten, with her giving birth to a mystical child who became the super-empowered leader of the Ori.  Adria (played by Monica Baccarin, Inara from FIREFLY) grew into a full-grown woman with overwhelming powers in a matter of weeks.  Throughout the season SG-1 has to struggle against their most powerful foe yet, who nonetheless harbors affection towards her mother, hoping to convert her to a belief in the Ori.What makes Season Ten work for me above all else is Claudia Black as Vala.  Although I have long been a fan of the show, I\\'ve long felt that there was a central problem in the core cast.  Though Richard Dean Anderson\\'s Jack O\\'Neill was ever the wise cracker, there was a lack of genuine humor at the core of the show and despite the implied attraction between O\\'Neill and Samantha Carter, no real romantic chemistry.  But Vala is really, truly funny and a real sex post as well.  And it was brilliant to team her with the wound-too-tight Daniel Jackson rather than Col. Mitchell (which would have been expected, since Black and Ben Browder portrayed what was perhaps THE great romantic couple in all of TV Sci-fi, Aeryn Sun and John Crichton on FARSCAPE).  Vala and Jackson are great together, with the unconventional and free-spirited Vala both appealing to and threatening the Boy Scout Jackson.  As a huge fan of Claudia Black\\'s Aeryn Sun, who was a stern and serious character, it was delightful seeing her be such a goofball on this show.  All in all, her character brought a bit of anarchism that was frequently lacking on the show.  If I have a regret with the series coming to an end, it is in not knowing what happens to her next.  In one of the most endearing touches of the season, the Stargate program only very gradually decides to allow Vala to become a part of the SG-1 team.  The season\\'s opening credits start off with the main four marching through the gate, but the week after she is allowed to join, just as the four start to walk through, Vala scampers up to join them.The main plot for the final season focused on the ongoing struggle against the Ori, a group of ultra religious fanatics.  With religious fundamentalism dominating both domestic and international news, with both Christian fundamentalists in the US trying to force public opinion to conform with their beliefs and Islamic fundamentalists trying to force the rest of Islam to conform with their violent and intolerant readings of the Koran (readings that the vast majority of Muslims do not agree with), nothing could be more relevant than intolerant religious zealots who are willing to kill those who do not agree with them.There were some significant farewells in Season Ten.  Samantha\\'s father, who had seen his life extended several years by accepting a symbiote and becoming a member of the Tok\\'ra, finally did die.  And not only Thor, but also the entirety of the Asgard died as well.Although STARGATE SG-1 was noted for its huge, epic, cliffhanging finales, the series finale was surprisingly subdued and quiet.  But also, I thought, remarkably appropriate.  I\\'m sure there was the temptation of a \"Big Ending,\" but instead they decided to focus instead on a relatively unspectacular, intimate episode in which time is essentially frozen for a few decades.  The main five simply spend some time together, while Vala and Daniel actually live a life of romantic bliss.  Typically, they manage a brilliant scientific solution to their dilemma at the end, with only Teal\\'c retaining any memory of the preceding decades.  As the show ends he smiles bemusedly as Vala and Daniel fall into their bickering ways.  But we know the potential that remains.So, a classic series comes to an end.  It wasn\\'t the best Sci-fi series ever.  It wasn\\'t the most ground breaking.  And it isn\\'t likely to be one of the more influential.  But it was the longest running uninterrupted Sci-fi series in the history of Sci-fi and introduced us to a host of memorable characters.  Yeah, it had some unpleasant quirks.  It used \"Science as Magic\" to such a degree that it almost became a parody of itself.  It reused plots endlessly.  I mean, just how many alternate universe episodes did we really need?  And how many times were there multiple copies of the same character?  (I suspect that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA\\'s refusal to use the same plot device twice or to EVER employ science in magical fashion owes a great deal to the abuse of both by SG-1.)  Still, the show took us to a host of wonderful places, introduced us to some wonderful enemies, and continually managed to entertain and delight.  And we got to know the core group of characters quite well.  Not many shows get ten seasons; even fewer manage ten seasons so well.  The show was starting to seem a bit old by the end, but it managed to do what almost no series ever gets to do:  last ten years and still have something left in the tank at the end.']\n",

I watched various Star Trek Series, Space 1999, The Avengers, Doctor Who, just to name very few.I loved them all for what they gave me; a momentary escapism.  They all have given me a place where I can immerse myself and enjoy the wonder of another place and time.Then came the Stargate SG-1.  I'm sure many will argue what is the most influential SciFi of all times.  But if you ask me what show gave me the most satisfying and lasting impression as the best SciFi, it's Stargate SG-1.I have to thank the writers and the chemistry of actors who made it the most enjoyable show.\"]\n",

            " ['and everything in between during the 10th season of \"Stargate: SG-1\". By the way, this ISN\\'T the end of SG-1 as two direct-to-video TV movies are due in 2008 with stand alone storylines. During the 10th season we get to see the resolution of the conflict between the alliance and the Ori, the end of the Asgardians and the continuing blossoming romance between Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Vala (Claudia Black). The show went through a lot of change during the last three seasons as storylines were wrapped up, new storyarcs developed and new characters such as Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder well known to sci-fi fans from \"Farscape\")and Vala (Claudia Black anther \"Farscape\" alum)providing the show with an additional injection of energy. Beau Bridges came on board adding spark to the show as well. Richard Dean Anderson is missed during the 10th and final season but his spirit is kept very much alive by Browder and Black in their roles. Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge proved to the the strongest link in the chain between the old Stargate and new.The story arc episodes are among the best while some of the stand alone episodes are (with the exception of a few) probably the weakest of the 10th season seeming like filler at times. The stand-alone episodes may or may not appeal to you like those on \"The X-Files\" and \"Farscape\" these episodes stand or fall based on the strength of the plotting and how realistic the wrap up is within 45 minutes. Some episodes as a result are better than others with some abrupt resolutions using the old ex deus machina (represented as help from Stargate Command or other sources sometimes unexpected)where more time could have been devoted to the story expanding it over more than one episode. As a long time \"Farscape\" fan I was happy to tag along after the cast changes and found that if you gave the final two seasons a chance, they were extremely good at the best of times.The show experienced a lot of change during the last three seasons which would make one expect them to be lesser seasons than the previous 7. Nothing could be further from the truth. The new characters were perfect additions to the show adding after the departure of Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack O\\'Neil. The addition of Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry to replace long time cast member Don Davis (Davis\\' character was promoted and he appeared in a couple of episodes during season nine)who played Major General George Hammond and various guest stars (Fred Willard, Robert Picardo a regular on \"Star Trek: Voyager\" started appearing in season 9) helped spruce up the last season of the show. It also helped that the Ori story arc was nicely resolved during the last season as well.The show looks pretty good but there are some digital artifacts evident in the transfers. Most of you won\\'t notice them or care but for those that do keep in mind the amount of information packed on each disc. The 10th season has been packaged in the slimline packaging that was rolled out with season 8. I\\'m sure these will show up on Blu-Ray but the show looks fine here and is well priced.The DVD has commentary tracks for every episode except one (and I suspect that was probably an accident as one episode has TWO commentary tracks. They probably scheduled the wrong episode for the second commentary track), deleted scenes, featurettes in the Director\\'s Series focusing on 1 director for 1 episode of each disc. We also got the usual assortment of photo and production galleries included as well. There is a trailer that for the first of the two Stargate direct-to-video movies \"Stargate SG-1: The Ark of Truth\" (the second one also coming in 2008 is \"Stargate SG-1: Continuum\" involving time travel and reportedly will feature Richard Dean Anderson).The 10th season varies but overall it\\'s a good one that SG-1 fans will enjoy.']\n",

Some of the dialogue is spoken so quickly and mumbled that I found it hard to make out. Some have made a bit much of the Boston accents here. I'm from Massachusetts. Mitchum's accent isn't bad, but it's not fully real. His performance as the small-time crook-turned-rat who fears going back to jail is fine, but it's no Oscar winner. I did like the depiction of early 70s Boston and its suburbs, replete with many of the horrible vintage 60s and 70s Detroit autos of the period. Seeing them again made me shudder. This was based on what was probably George Higgins' best crime novel. I've never read it. Don't expect today's production values with this film. Everything moves a lot more slowly, and many shots needed tighter editing.\"]\n",

Eddie Coyle (Robert Mitchum) is a worn out, two-bit gunrunner. He provides untraceable revolvers when required. He draws the line at machine guns. Eddie is honorable in his way. He loves his family. He\\'s just a low life who isn\\'t all that shrewd. The fix he\\'s in, because he can\\'t take any more jail time, is what this superb Peter Yates\\' movie is all about.\"Look. I\\'m gettin\\' old, y\\'hear?\" Eddie tells a young hood who deals in machine guns. \"I spend most of my life hangin\\' around crummy joints with the punks drinkin\\' the beer, eatin\\' the hash an\\' hot dogs and watchin\\' the other people go off to Florida while I\\'m sweatin\\' how I\\'m goin\\' to pay the plumber. I done time when I stood up but I can\\'t take no more chances. Next time it\\'s goin\\' to be me goin\\' to Florida.\" Now he\\'s facing more prison time for foolishly agreeing to drive a getaway car when he should have asked his friends some questions. He\\'ll do just about anything to cut a deal for no jail time. He\\'s nearly 50. He doesn\\'t want his wife to go on welfare, doesn\\'t want his three kids made fun of because their old man is doing time. He\\'s squeezed by Dave Foley to inform...and Eddie decides he\\'ll rat a little. He\\'s too believing to understand he might be tagged for ratting big time. It\\'s all betrayal, but Eddie doesn\\'t really understand betrayal. All those friends of Eddie\\'s make us wary every time we meet them: Scalise (Alex Rocco), who robs banks, sometimes violently; Jackie (Steve Keats), the dangerous dealer in stolen machine guns; Dillon (Peter Boyle), owner of a low-life bar who knows more about things than Eddie does.The movie looks as hopeless as the Boston weather. It\\'s the cold end of fall, filled with drab, chill days where parking lot asphalt is always wet. We\\'re into Eddie\\'s life in the low lane, where the anchors in the crummy strip malls are a tired Woolworth\\'s and Barbo\\'s Furniture Store. It\\'s a lousy life and it belongs to Eddie Coyle. \"Have a nice day.\"Director Peter Yates sets up scenes -- an exchange of machine guns, a bank robbery, a family held hostage, a stakeout in a commuter train lot, a night on the town -- that are so naturally established that we might miss how skillfully they build the story and show us Eddie\\'s life. We\\'re never sure if things are as hopeless for Eddie as they seem. Yates keeps us on edge, and he adds layers of Eddie Coyle\\'s sad and foolish trust.This is one of Robert Mitchum\\'s best performances. Mitchum still looks like he might be a tough guy, but his Eddie Coyle is a man who has had the force of his life wrung out of him. He\\'s been in the life forever. He does the jobs others ask him to. He doesn\\'t ask very many questions. He\\'s just not smart enough. Mitchum takes all the hard edges off his usual persona and gives us an aging loser whose life is on the skids, and who doesn\\'t understand just how badly off he is.The Criterion release looks just fine. There is a commentary by Peter Yates.']\n",

            " ['Though often dismissed by critics as \"walking through\" his roles, Robert Mitchum) was perhaps Hollywood\\'s most underrated actor.  True, many of his films were not worthy of his talent, but when he did get a good script (e.g. THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, HEAVEN KNOWS MR. ALLISON, CAPE FEAR), his performance was always mesmerizing.Arguably, Mitchum\\'s finest screen performance can be found in THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE (1973), now available on DVD from The Criterion Collection.Directed by Peter Yates, who supplies audio commentary on the disc, the film is set in Boston and casts Mitchum as a small-time felon, a family man facing a 2-5 year sentence on a smuggling conviction.  His only hope of avoiding prison is to give an FBI agent (Richard Jordan) information that will help to bring down some bigger bad guys...like the men who have been on a bank-robbing spree and killed a teller during their last job.Mitchum\\'s problem is that, if he \"rats\" on those guys, his life is not worth a plugged nickel.Peter Boyle co-stars in the picture, playing Mitchum\\'s \"friend,\" a former felon who is now a bartender and also supplies confidential information to the Feds.Adapted from the novel by George V. Higgins by Paul Monash, this is a gritty, first-rate crime drama, shot in almost a semi-documentary style.

            " ['\"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\", adapted from the novel by George V. Higgins, is exemplary of the kind of film noir that was unique to the 1970s. It shares the chaotic noir world with films of the 1940s, but protagonist is fast being rendered irrelevant by a rapidly changing world where even corruption isn\\'t what it used to be, and he knows it. It\\'s fitting, then, that the protagonist should be played by an aging Robert Mitchum, conflicted hero of more than a few films of the classic noir cycle. Eddie Coyle (Robert Mitchum) is a hood who runs guns for the Boston mob. Caught in a recent trucking job set up by his bar-owning friend Dillon (Peter Boyle), Coyle is looking at a probable 3-5 years in prison. He can\\'t afford to do the time, so he considers snitching on his gun supplier to a federal agent, Dave Foley (Richard Jordan), but the feds are more interested in a recent string of bank robberies.Eddie Coyle is a man from another era. He ponders how much and whom he is willing to betray to keep himself out of prison. He paternalistically lectures his young gun supplier (Steven Keats) about how rough the business is and the importance of caution and reliability. Eddie is playing by some old rulebook that is no longer applies. He doesn\\'t realize he\\'s being played by just about everyone. He catches on too late to how the game of cops and robbers is currently conducted. \"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\" was an ironic title for a cynical and depressed era. Made the year the Watergate scandal broke, it\\'s hardly surprising that law enforcement is portrayed as no more ethical than outright criminality. Shot on location in Boston, director Peter Yates\\' style is unadorned but includes a lot of procedure -how guns are obtained and banks robbed- that enhance the film\\'s aura of authenticity.The DVD (Criterion Collection 2009): Spine #475. Bonus features are a Stills Gallery of 22 behind-the-scenes images captioned by director Peter Yates and a feature commentary by Yates, recorded in 2009. This is one of Yates\\' favorite 3 films of the 25 films he directed. He talks about choosing the locations, the cast and performances, including a lot about Mitchum\\'s work on this film, his own \"style of reality and simplicity\", and the filmmaking process. Also included is a booklet featuring an essay by film critic Kent Jones and a 1973 profile of Robert Mitchum from \"Rolling Stone\".']\n",
            " ['\"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\" is a 1970\\'s crime movie, with great dialogue, acting, and intrigue. The movie reminded me of \"The Sopranos\" more than classic film noir. \"Eddie Coyle\" is more realistic and subdued than a lot of noir. It also has a lot of criminals interacting: pulling capers, making deals, and distrusting each other, like some of the criminals in \"The Sopranos\". It\\'s centered more on the interaction of the characters and the story than on action. There are several great scenes, where the dialogue and the acting are engaging, particularly when Robert Mitchum speaks. I\\'ve never been a fan of Robert Mitchum, but here he\\'s excellent, bringing a lot of emotion and weariness to Eddie Coyle. The story is also very good, as we see Eddie struggle to stay out of jail. The DVD is from The Criterion Collection, and looks good. There is a new commentary track from director Peter Yates. I don\\'t think this film will appeal to a wide audience, because it\\'s completely a crime film and nothing else, but fans of crime films might thoroughly enjoy it.

            " [\"As I've said in all my reviews, I love the Stargate shows SG-1 and Atlantis, not so Universe.  I like the way they spun off the whole Atlantis discovery as the foundation for extending SG-1 which was great, but ran it's course and was in decline at the end.  It allowed some new characters, albeit with familiar personalities, along with keeping alive some old favorites with vague tie in's to their ongoing lives as well as bringing Samantha Carter back for a season to head the program (in addition to all her guest appearances).  I think the 3rd season of Atlantis was its best.  I knew from the start it would have a shorter shelf life than SG=1 because the premiss had already been pretty thoroughly explored in SG=1. A whole new universe allowed for some new bad guys, but the SG teams and the predicaments they can get into are finite before they are like plots different show.  I enjoyed their greater familiarity with the ancient technology but being Hyperspace or Warp drives, the technology is simply a backdrop to the episode storyline and seasonal/show ones.  I couldn't have stood waiting as long watching Stargate for them to develop defensive technologies and fight the enemies effectively.  I enjoyed the show and season 3 was at its peak as it was becoming a formula rotated through the seasons by season 4 and season 5 it is hard to get enthused when it begins by them canning a long time character who was well liked by fans and characters, replacing her with someone that I would have enjoyed having run Stargate for two shows and then get eaten by a Raithe no matter how much they tried to make it fun watching him have to change his ways to deal with the realities of being in the field.  The characters had become familiar such that losing main ones was difficult in this season making for some heavy shows, but also began the rotation that made it less upsetting when one was lost.  The only thing that sort of always left me in question was how on Atlantis they dealt with exploring an entire Galaxy with a few SG teams while back in the Milky Way they had a ton.  I realize there were more finite resources in the beginning, but by season 3 they had the huge city fairly up and running and enough trade partners to support a much larger military presence which all things considered I think back home on earth they would have been cranking out as many starships as possible because in the big picture they would need a fleet not a couple of ships.  i know they added on, but over years given the stakes I believe an international governing body would be funding mass production of those things so there was always one by earth, one by Atlantis and others for missions and with force.  It is part of what started to become a little to familiar, the desperate situation with impossible odds solved by a miraculous discovery at the last minute.  Great for a show, or a movie, but when it becomes cyclical it eventually translates to a show formula and the interest just begins to wane.  I did appreciate the writing around the problems they faced were of their own making many times (waking the wraithe early, messing with the replicator programming, genetic experiments on the wraithe to make them human) and the moral questions they raise in parallel with the real world application of genetics.  How much knowledge is to much before we are dabbling in areas we don't have enough seem to be evolved enough to have in our hands as they represent to much power, to much danger.  But for Star Gate fans I think Atlantis was a comfortable spin off that allowed a few more years of enjoyment of their &#34;world&#34; but unlike the Star Trek franchise that dealt with all universes the &#34;world&#34; created via the stargates became to self contained limiting the growth of the plots.  Bottom line is by this season you know what your getting and enjoying it, where in the seasons to come it started to get old and thus the show faded away.  Good, even great for periods, but limited from the start by being set in the present.  Great run while it lasted.\"]\n",

Sure, they appear in a few good episodes, but it didn\\'t seem like the story with respect to them in particular moved at all.Second, killing off Dr. Beckett.  I really liked him.  Maybe I\\'m dating myself a bit here, but he was kind of like Scotty and McCoy rolled together but with a cooler head.  This very lovable character will be missed.Third, rehashing the replicators.  With an entirely new galaxy as our backdrop for this series, why do the replicator thing all over again?  It was original enough on Stargate SG-1, but I was amazed that Atlantis started a story arc with replicators too.  Are they going creatively bankrupt already?Fourth, rehashing old sci-fi standbys, like the \"weird alien thingy or disease that causes loyal comrades to start killing each other\".  Did the original Star Trek do this in the episode \"The Naked Time\" and wasn\\'t it done again by Star Trek Next Generation as the second or third episode in that series?Fifth, bringing back a whole ship full of \"ancients\" just to kill them all off by the end of the two part episode.  So, the \"ancients\" have gone from being a great and mysterious race of humanoids from the past to an expediant plot device.  We can create them and destroy them at will just to get and episode or two.  Couldn\\'t an \"ancient\" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters?  Wouldn\\'t that have been interesting?  They could have helped explore the rest of the city.  Their ship could have been recovered.  There\\'s so much that could have been done with them that wasn\\'t.Sixth, lack of character development.  Tayla could be a full-fledged warrior princess with a rich heritage and tons of wisdom, but she seems little more than a pretty (to say the least) face with a great body who never uses contractions (reminds me of Barbara Eden in I Dream of Jeanie) and tilts her head a lot.  And then there\\'s Ronan the Monotone Macho man who does nothing for me but must appeal to a certain demographic so he\\'s still there.Still, the season ended with a special effects spectacular and a tightly written script that showed just what the Atlantis team is capable of.  And, of course there\\'s the wealth of special features and commentaries that you get as part of the standard package with Stargate franchise DVD sets, and that greatly adds to the value of the set.I haven\\'t seen any of season four.

I definitely plan on continuing to watch it, but I have some concerns about the show that I\\'m convinced have to be addressed for it to continue to be worth watching.First and foremost, ATLANTIS has always had and continues to have serious cast problems.  They have now had three complete seasons to address these problems and while they have played with it some, most of their decisions have been odd at best.  I really like Joe Flannigan as Sheppard and David Hewlett as Rodney, but beyond that the cast is mainly made up of liabilities.  There was one other actor I liked a lot on the show, Paul McGillion as Beckett, but inexplicably in remaking the cast they chose to kill off one of the few strong characters on the show.  Rachel Luttrell as Teyla is more baffling.  Her character has never been very interesting, but I\\'m not convinced that Luttrell is untalented.  I suspect that for whatever reason the writers have simply not been willing or able to come up with any interesting arcs for her (apart from having an interesting connection to the wraiths, which by and large has been underutilized).  My hope is that they will rethink Teyla and either do both her and us a favor and kill her off, or become more aggressive in writing her character and give her some significant arcs and character development.  Jason Momoa as Ronon, however, is probably a lost cause.  He is perhaps the most wooden actor on television today and they have done virtually nothing of interest with his character.  David Nykl, however, is good as Zelenka.  I always enjoy his scenes with Rodney.  Finally, I really want to like Torri Higginson (not least because she bears a scary resemblance to an ex-girlfriend of mine).  I love shows that feature strong and interesting female characters, but after three years she remains yet another character with whom they\\'ve been unable to do very much.  In her case, however, it appears that the producers have decided to either write her out of the show entirely or reduce her merely to a recurring character.  I will continue to watch and sometimes enjoy STARGATE ATLANTIS, but they really need to do some serious rehabilitation.Some help is on the way.  We know that Amanda Tapping and her character Samantha Carter will be moving over from the cancelled STARGATE SG-1 to become the new head of the Atlantis project.  I think she will bring more strength to the role than Torri Higginson did.  Normally I would also applaud the casting of Jewel Staite as the new base doctor.  I loved her on FIREFLY as Kaylee, but I still regret Beckett\\'s leaving the show.  But I honestly feel that the cast needs several more major changes.  The show has had to rely far too heavily on Sheppard and Rodney.The end of Season Three did, however, leave hope for new and better things.  Atlantis has emerged as the name not of a location that cannot be moved, but of a truly mobile city that can relocate . . . well, to anywhere.  The season ends with the city blasting off into space.  I\\'m anxious to see what happens next.  But whatever they do, I would like to see the show continue the risks it started taking in Season Three.  Killing Beckett was an abominable mistake (especially given that there were some other characters who could have been killed with far greater profit to the show), but it at least started giving the show something that both it and SG-1 have always lacked:  a body count.  The good adventure shows have body counts.  SG-1 had next to none.  The only truly heartbreaking death in ten seasons was when Dr. Frasier was killed.  It is no accident that that the episode in which that occurred was one of the finest in the series\\' run.  If you don\\'t have a body count, you get no sense of danger.  On shows like BUFFY, LOST, and BATTLESTAR GALACTIC they have killed off some important characters.  As a result when a character is in danger you get a degree of danger that you never, ever get on ATLANTIS or SG-1.  Well, at least until they killed off Beckett and at least seriously injured Weir.  I dearly hope they continue doing this in the future.I also hope that we see Season Four taking the stories of the Wraith and the replicators to newer and more complex levels.  The series has had some great moments over the first three seasons, especially when they let situations get really desperate.  Hopefully they will continue to do this.While Season Three frequently left me wanting more due to the weaknesses in the overall cast, there were some great moments.  The season finale (both SG-1 and ATLANTIS have had some fine season enders) was splendid.  And the season featured what may be my favorite episode of the entire series so far in \"Common Ground,\" in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a wraith who is allowed to feed on no one else.  Christopher Heyerdahl has played several wraiths on the series, but in this episode he was allowed to give this particular wraith a dignity and complexity not allowed any other wraith with the exception of Michael.  He gradually drains the life out of Sheppard out of sheer necessity before the two of them, cooperating as human and wraith never have before, manage to escape from the Genii.  Then, in a moment that could lead to interesting plot developments in the future, we discover that the wraiths cannot only drain another creature of life, they can also imbue them with it, and as a sign of comradeship he heals Sheppard.  I want arcs like this one!  On a host of other series some of the most interesting characters have been those who came over from the other side.  On STAR TREK: VOYAGER, we had Seven of Nine; on BUFFY we had Angel, Anya, and Spike; currently on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA we have Sharon Agathon and (possibly) Caprica Six; and on SG-1 we had Teal\\'c.  I think it would be fascinating if they could do something like that with a wraith.So I wait for the beginning of Season Four with some nervousness.  The show has some weaknesses and problems, but they are fixable.  The series has not lost any of its potential.  But until we see how the new city in the air Atlantis works in terms of story and how the new cast changes affect the chemistry we won\\'t know for sure.  One thing is for certain.  Season Four should bear little resemblance to any of the first three seasons.']\n",

            " ['This is by far the best season so far. I kept looking forward for nighttime to watch an episode.One thing I like about this season is that some episodes follow on the previous ones. In other words, many episodes are not standalone. Many viewers do prefer standalone episodes, and producers certainly do. For producers, having standalone episodes means a viewer can jump in and watch the series at anytime during the season. This has the benefit of increasing ratings. For some viewers, standalone episodes are also an advantage since they can watch and enjoy an episode without having seen any other episodes. I, on the other hand, prefer continuity, sort of like 24 Hours. For this reason, I thought this season of Stargate Atlantis to be the best.I do have a few comments about this season:1. Dr. Beckett dies in a very simple plot. I was really very disappointed. Beckett was one of my favorite characters, and I often wished he was given more of a principal role. The writers also did a lousy job in the episode in which he was killed. They could have killed him off in two or three one-hour episodes that followed up on each other, thus adding more suspense and thrill. On the other side of the coin, though, killing off a principal character also means that all characters on the show are susceptible to death--none are superhuman. We know James Bond never dies in his movies. However, next time a character is threatened with death in Stargate Atlantis, we will be glued to our seats, wondering whether he or she will die! `Death in the air\\' makes the episodes more suspenseful.2. The character of Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) has not been developed, and she does not have much to say that is interesting. She is also dressed up in a way to make her look sexy. Shouldn\\'t she be wearing a uniform? Can you imagine a female soldier in Iraq wearing her outfit?3. Jason Momoa as Ronon is another underdeveloped character. Sometimes he is annoying. He also is sparsely dressed, being topless most of the time. Like Teyla, I would imagine he\\'d wear a uniform. Don\\'t they ever get cold?4. Dr. Weir\\'s (Torri Higginson) character is also weak. She should be given more principal roles. There are rumors that she might be replaced in upcoming seasons.5. There is too much Rodney in this season, and this gets to be annoying at times.6. In one episode, a ship full of ancients is found. They reclaim Atlantis, and basically kick out the Stargate team from the city, who all return back to Earth. However, in the second episode they are all killed. That was really bad storytelling. As one reviewer pointed out, couldn\\'t an \"ancient\" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters in latter episodes? They could have helped explore the rest of the city and reveal its many secrets. We could have also known more about the ancients and their culture. Furthermore, their ship could have been recovered and used to fight the Wraiths. There\\'s so much that could have been done with the surviving ancients that wasn\\'t.7. The episode \"Common Ground,\" in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a Wraith was fascinating. We discover that the Wraiths not only drain another creature of life, but can also give life as well. For the first time, a bond is formed between a Wraith and a human. Wraiths are shown to be human after all. Humans hunt and kill prey (animals) in order to survive. Wraiths kill humans because we are prey to them, and they need to feed on us to survive. Viewed in this context, aren\\'t Wraiths and humans the same? It all boils down to survival of the fittest.The season ends with the city blasting off into space. Having lost all power, it just floats in space. I can\\'t wait for season 4!']\n",

The other convicts lives are on the line as well since all of them have been ordered to be killed. They also want Dr. Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies) dead or anyone else who has tried to help Scofield and his brother. To show that these guys aren't messing around, season 1 regular Veronica (Robin Tunney) is killed violenty at the end of the first episode of this season.William Fichtner plays Agent Alexander Mahone who we think just wants to catch them but it later turns out that he has been ordered to kill them. Plus that's not all that makes this guy a threat....he's extremely smart and always seems to know what Scofield's next move is going to be. Which is another thing that makes this season so thrilling. You never really know what this guy is going to do next or who he's going to find next. I was hoping he'd find and kill T-Bag (Robert Knepper) but that sleaze ball makes it through the whole season. I don't wanna see this guy die because Knepper is bad at playing him or anything. I wanna see him die because Knepper is fantastic at making you hate this worthless piece of garbage. He's a rat that kills innocent people and slizzers his way away through most the season.Paul Adelstein as Agent Paul Kellerman is back after Scofield and Burrows. But he makes some important decisions as the season goes on and turns out to be just what they need if they want to clear Burrows' name. So there's a lot of character development going on in this season. There's a lot of running going on this season but since this show has great writing it's always engaging and you never really know what is going to happen next. So it's not just a whole lot of brainless chase scenes through the whole season. It's always exciting and has you at the edge of your seat. Plus there is still some scenes where they are captured and have to figure out how to escape. Hell this season has everything really. It's really a must see!\"]\n",
            " ['The first season of \"Prison Break\" was amazing and it solidified it as one of the best new shows on network television. When it ended, with the escape of 8 of the convicts; I wondered how they would keep the show going. Well, they did it...The 2nd season is different from season 1 in scenery and in story. And, I\\'m going to get this out of the way right now, it\\'s not quite as good as season 1. The first season was smart, suspenseful, and entertaining. Season 2 is suspenseful and entertaining...But not a single episode on here captured the heart-pounding 2nd to last episode of season 1. Still, viewing all these episodes a 2nd time (I watched them all while they were airing); It\\'s still an amazing show. When the show begins; Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) have successfully broken out of Fox River. Along with them are John Abruzzi (Peter Stormare), Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco),David \"Tweener\" Apolskiss (Lane Garrison, who\\'s had a recent run-in with the law himself), Theodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell (Robert Knepper), Benjamin \"C-Note\" Miles Franklin, and Haywire. With the entire world knowing their faces, they \"Fox River 8\" begin running...With new character, F.B.I. man Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) guessing their every move. This season develops the relationship between Michael and Sara, the doctor who aided the cons in their escape, and also makes you feel more for the characters. One amazing aspect of this show is that you actually like the characters and want them to succeed despite their wrongdoings. The best example I have of this is the character T-Bag, a convicted rapist & pedophile who is easily the most dangerous of the bunch. Many viewers of this show have a strong connection to T-Bag and love the character. This is not a result of good writing, but a result of good acting. Robert Knepper plays this character so well, you root for T-Bag to succeed. You don\\'t want to see him killed off or shipped back to prison. The fact that the Emmy awards haven\\'t even acknowledged Knepper is a complete travesty. If this was a movie, Knepper would be nominated for an Oscar. But all the actors are good and with season 2, they\\'ve only got better at playing the roles. They\\'re gotten under their character\\'s skin and have really became them. The chemistry between Miller and Purcell is terrific. You believe that they are actually brothers. Fichtner as Mahone is terrific as well. He has that icy stare and intenseness that John Malkovich has and does an amazing job as the sympathetic F.B.I. agent that you love to hate. Like I said, the show isn\\'t as smart as season 1...There\\'s many episodes where they seemed to make up things as they went along (Michael\\'s tattoo has become a ploy and a plot device. The writer\\'s can make new tattoos appear whenever they wish) and the way they handled the Haywire character could have been better. There were times when they disregarded him for several episodes, when really he should have been caught by episode 3. There\\'s no way that Haywire could\\'ve remained out longer than Abruzzi. But the suspense factor is way up there. Every episode has me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next (Even though, I already knew which makes it even more impressive). If you haven\\'t jumped on the \"Prison Break\" bandwagon yet, you should...I missed the season 3 premiere last night and I truly want to cry, because I can\\'t wait to see what happens next. When you have a TV show that can you get that pumped up, you know you\\'ve found something special...And \"Prison Break\" is damned special all right. Fine acting, terrific writing, and nail-biting suspense. I said this is my review for season 1 a long time ago, but I\\'m going to state it again. If this was a movie, you can bet that Oscars would be involved.GRADE: A']\n",

Michael (Wentworth Miller), Linc (Dominic Purcell), Sucre (Amaury Nolasco), C-Note (Rockmond Dunbar), and John (Peter Stormare) have escaped from prison and are on the run.  After going their seperate ways, shady FBI Agent Mahone (William Fichtner) arrives on the scene with one main intention: stop Michael and Linc from escaping the country.  In the meantime, T-Bag (Robert Knepper) goes to some great lengths to get what he wants, and Captain Bellick (Wade Williams) is still hot on the brothers' trail.  The conspiracy that was apparent in season one is even more farther reaching here, as revelations are made that will cost everyone involved dearly, and by the end of the season, not everyone that has been here since the beginning will still be standing.  What makes Prison Break so good is that the show never relents from it's break neck pacing.  This could easily be a bad thing, but the minds behind Prison Break manage to keep the constant flow stable enough so you never know what to expect next.  Even with the major change of scenery for the main characters, the show stays more compelling than ever as it becomes a high octane game of cat and mouse.  Undoubtedly one of (if not the) best shows on prime time network television today (and on Fox), Prison Break just keeps getting better, and by the end of the season finale, you'll be salivating for more.\"]\n",

            " ['My overriding impression of \"Bones Season 2\" is that perhaps Booth and Brennan were getting too close in season one, and forces needed to be put in place to put some distance between the two. The first was by replacing Jonathan Adams (Dr. Daniel Goodman) with Tamara Taylor (Dr. Camille Saroyan) as Brennan\\'s boss, who, by the way, had a romantic relation with Booth when they were in New York. The second was to introduce a romantic interest for Brennan, in the form of FBI agent Tim Sullivan (Sully), who replaces Booth while he is sidelined for a psychiatric evaluation by the premier guest character on \"Bones\", Gordon, Gordon Wyatt, played by Stephen Fry.Wyatt and Booth have some of the most delicious scenes outside of the episodes where Booth and Brennan get close.In retrospect, it is just a bit hard to take the interchange between Brennan and Saroyan in the first few episodes. Booth is surprised at her arrival, and resists Saroyan\\'s direction. I suppose the reason it\\'s odd is because we all suspect from the outset that in the lab, and with Booth, Brennan will always be the alpha dog. After all, the show is named after her.Overall, I would say season 2 is as good as season 1, and better than season 3 (It is rated better than both seasons 1 and 3.) Season 1 had the \"getting to work together jitters\" and season 2 had the \"separation moves\". The main season 3 arc was simply not as good.']\n",

            " ['O Happy Day! As presented in widescreen, here\\'s Season 2 of Bones. The great news is that there\\'s no slack off at all from season one\\'s most excellent run. Involving forensic conundrums and grim visions of death once again winningly meld with great drama, humor, pathos, and tenuous romance. Emily Deschanel as forensic anthropologst Dr. Temperance \"Bones\" Brennan and David Boreanaz as FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) continue to dazzle as television\\'s most electric investigative duo.Whereas Booth is the intuitive people person, Brennan is still mostly socially in the dark. She remains dispassionate and driven in her pursuit of her personal Holy Grail, the truth. As always, her ability for drawing accurate observations from ruined human remains proves invaluable in solving FBI cases. As ever, the perceptive Booth and her free spirited best friend Angela are her main conduits to understanding the, to her, bewildering labyrinth of emotions and social decorum. Deschanel is great at allowing the audience to glimpse the wounds just beneath Bones\\' supremely confident exterior. She and Boreanaz are magical, and their chemical synergy remains the overwhelming draw of this series.There\\'s a barrage of big technical jargon used on each episode, but that doesn\\'t keep me from being sofa-ed in rapt attention. This show is so clever that my attitude more or less echoes Booth\\'s: \"Keep talking. I\\'ll catch up.\" The mysteries are compelling enough, but when thrown in with the engrossing human elements, it makes me want to tune in to the show that much more. The squints, while intimidatingly brainy and toiling away on a wavelength drastically foreign from that of average folks, are nevertheless engaging and very sympathetic characters. The supporting cast is remarkably good and quirky, bolstered by this season\\'s newcomer Tamara Taylor and by occasional guest stints by Ryan O\\'Neal, Stephen Fry, and the wonderful Patricia Belcher (as no-nonsense attorney Caroline Julian). It must be noted that T.J. Thyne (Hodgins) and Michaela Conlin (Angela) share an endearing chemistry.Season 2 introduces a couple of curve balls, beginning with the arrival of Dr. Camille Saroyan (Taylor) as Brennan\\'s new boss at the Jeffersonian Institute, with whom Bones instantly clashes. Then mix in some office romances (except the one we\\'re hankering for). Offer up a serial killer or two. And, thru all the cases she works on, Bones still fixates on her mother\\'s unsolved murder and her father\\'s disappearance. On this, some light will be shed.My favorite episodes are \"The Truth in the Lye\" (Tub of goo!! So cool tub of goo!! To quote Bones: \"Even for me, this is disgusting.\"), \"The Woman in the Sand\" (Booth goes ultimate fighting and, Omigawd, Bones in a sexy black cocktail dress!), \"Aliens in a Spaceship\" (Hodgins and Brennan are entombed in a car and must come up with makeshift ways to surviva as air runs out; raw-emotioned acting by Thyne and Deschanel), the nerve-wracking \"The Blonde in the Game\" and its equally harrowing follow-up \"The Man in the Cell\" features the return of clever serial killer Howard Epps from last season\\'s \"A Man on Death Row\") and the season-ender \"Stargazer in the Puddle\" (Bones learns more about her mother).Special Features include optional episode commentaries on \"The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House\" (with Emily Deschanel) and on \"Stargazer in a Puddle.\" Boreanaz doesn\\'t commentate this time; perhaps, his effort last season was deemed too loopy. Disc 6 offers \"The Memories in the Season\" featurette; \"Visceral Effects: The Digital Illusions of Bones\" featurette; 8 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by the Executive Producers; and the gag reel.By the way, the episode commentary on \"The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House\" reveals that an unaired 22nd episode will debut in the third season. Does that mean there\\'ll be 23 episodes in season 3? One hopes (but doubts).']\n",
            " [\"This second season is exploring new ways and avenues where bones are of course multiplying at leisure and for our best pleasure. Yet this second season is quite new in several aspects.First and foremost the season is widely open to personal matters and it explores the private, and at times not so private, relations between the members of the team, after the boss has been changed to a woman, which rebalances the sexual ratios. Bones herself is courting and going out with an FBI agent who has temporarily replaced Booth while he was sort of suspended and deprived of a gun after shooting a clown on top of an ice-cream vendor's van. But in the end she will not go through the process completely as far as leaving the Jeffersonian for a life of full leisure and farniente.Zack manages to get his doctorate and to be hired in the job he was holding as an intern because he goes to Angela and begs for help on his  look and manages to become presentable, which means he can now stand in court and testify seriously in a deportment that can carry the agreement of the jury. So far he is no longer obsessed by sexuality but he encounters a great difficulty: he is summoned by the White House to go to Iraq. But this time this reference does not lead to any political dissertation or even cogitation on the subject. Political questions are systematically and carefully avoided in this second season.Jack and Angela are finally realizing they love each other and even decide to get married and they finally find themselves in front of a priest (in fact a black priestess) in some church for the last step when the State Department steps in and reveals Angela is already married in some kind of broom stick over-jumping ceremony. More later, I guess.Booth is entangled in the hands of a British shrink after his shooting the clown on the ice-cream vendor's van and he is a perfect sucker, building a full barbecue for the shrink under the shrink's blackmailing procedure of retaining the document he must sign. This same shrink will also step into Bones' psyche as some kind of private counselor. Agent Booth and Doctor Brennan will not be able to establish some kind of personal relationship, especially since Temperance's father reappears in her life and even saves the situation a couple of times. But he has to be arrested by Booth and be brought to court for his ancient crimes, including the attack against the deputy chief of the FBI, though this one was crooked to the utmost, his lips kissing the heels of his shoes or something like that.Booth reestablishes for a short while a relationship with the new boss of the institute, Dr Camille Saroyan, with whom he had had a liaison some time ago in another life. But that cannot last more than one or two episodes. This is characteristic of all these people: they are unable psychologically or administratively to build balanced and normal relationships. Is it a side effect of their jobs or professions, we can wonder, or simply  personal immaturity?That level of the season blurs out the various crimes and cases they examine and solve. And these cases do not deal with political issues or even with immigration, except one case about some strange Chinese practice of burying the bones of a man with the bones of a woman so that the man has some company on the other side of the road. Most cases are plain simple crimes in America and among Americans. But they often deals with social problems like the mother of a severely handicapped girl: what can the mother do to help her child the genetic victim of a deadly disease that keeps her retarded, even if it is only for a short time before she dies? Some of these questions are crucial: do we have the right to experiment on human beings new treatments that would enable astronauts to reinforce their bones that get highly decalcified due to prolonged sojourn in space?Some of the cases are plain vicious crimes and it is fun to catch the killers who are most of the time not at all the one or the ones we were expecting. Suspense is always with us even if the personal and more sentimental level of this season makes that suspense not as intense as I would personally prefer it to be.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID\"]\n",

Which clears her, and allows Gibbs to go back to Mexico. But not for long, as Fornell asks Gibbs\\'s help in solving a case, which he does. And decides to come back to NCIS for good, the stories in season four are outstanding. The Halloween story alone is worth watching, as a marine is attacked in his home. And his daughter is kidnapped, and all throughout the case, Ziva thinks that the Daughter\\'s mother is the one who kidnapped her own daughter. But alas, in the end she is wrong.  Or the creepy episode, \"Smoked\". Where a body is found in a chimney, the body of a sadistic serial killer with a toe in his stomach, only come to find out his wife was the actual killer. As she buried the bodies in their yard, and the episode ends with Gibbs asking fornell how he thought the toe got in the guys stomach. There are two threads of stories throughout this season, one is Tony has a new girlfriend, and Gibbs has a Girlfriend Col. Hollis Mann. We also find out, that Mcgee is a fictional writer. We\\'re introduced to Shariff, in two incredible episodes, where they stop the terrorist the first time, and Gibbs is almost killed the second time they meet. Also in this season, we eventually find out that Tony\\'s girlfriend is his undercover assignment for Director Shepard. As she tries to get an international arms dealer  La Grenoulle, now Ducky had been mad at Gibbs for quitting, but eventually they become friends again. And Paula Cassidy and her team are killed in an explosion, in a really powerful episode, season four ends with Jeanne and Dinnozo getting in a limo, which is her father\\'s, and there is La Grenoulle. Season four again, is the last of the great NCIS seasons.']\n",

            " ['Season 4 of NCIS comes off as more a labyrinth than \"The Season Of Secrets\" as CBS promoted it.  The main characters all seem to start in different areas--Gibbs in Mexico, Tony as Team Leader, Tim no longer the \"Probie\", Ziva being Ziva...but as the season rolls on, all the lines start coming together.  Jethro\\'s return from Mexico isn\\'t exactly greeted by Jenny Sheppard, and Ducky Mallard\\'s indifference to Gibbs is puzzling.  Tony is in a serious relationship (Or is he?), and it\\'s driving Ziva to distraction.  Tim has suddenly come into money--lots of it, evidently.  Abby is falling for a little person.  Ducky\\'s assistant Jimmy Palmer is finding himself in a hot affair with the new Probie.And Jenny is running an off-the-books investigation that gets the Christians In Action (Initials, folks) upset at NCIS.It\\'s a complicated season where all the characters undergo some changes; mostly pleasant but some not.  Mark Harmon brings Gibbs back from Mexico a little softer (Though not to the team)--enough to allow himself a relationship.  Michael Weatherly gets to have Tony grow up--some--and have his well-known intrusiveness into his coworker\\'s private lives flipped on him by Ziva.  Cote De Pablo allows the Mossad liason to fall for an ill-fated nuclear inspector in \"Dead Man Walking\", but Ziva starts having \"Tony issues\" that don\\'t slap her in the face until the end of the season.  Pauley Perrette\\'s Abby is as she ever is--the attempt to give up \"Kaff-Pow!!\" was classic.  David McCallum\\'s Ducky allows some hurt to show through in his relationship with Gibbs early in the year.  Brian Dietzen and Liza Lapira\\'s sequences in-and-around the morgue were wonderful asides, and made up for the missing \"head slaps\".But Lauren Holly was most intriguing in this season.  She took a character which some viewers considered cheesecake in Season 3, and gave her a very uneasy edge.  The investigation of La Grenouille seemed legitimate, but as the season went on, Jen\\'s personal stake--and what it could cost NCIS--became apparent.  This led to Sheppard not being cast in a good light through much of the second half of the season.This season also became a good spotlight for many of the recurring characters.  Certainly key to the season were Susanna Thompson--Hollis Mann, the CID investigator who got Gibbs\\' attention--and Scottie Thompson as Jeanne Benoit, the doctor who made DiNozzo settle down.  Joe Spano\\'s usual visits as T.C. Fornell, the FBI agent/friend/rival to Jethro were a delight.  But Muse Watson\\'s Mike Franks--Gibbs\\' team leader when Jethro first joined the then-NIS--was a treat; an old-fashioned type who got things done not within the rules (Wonder where Jethro got that from?).  We lose Jessica Steen\\'s Paula Cassidy in \"Grace Period\", and that\\'s a shame.  But Armand Assante\\'s was insidious and slick as \"The Frog\", and David Dayan Fisher\\'s turn as Trent Kort--the CIA operative in with La Grenouille--is also notable.In it\\'s run, NCIS has always had an ongoing storyline that gets buried in the usual action--the identity of the terroist who infiltrated the MTAC in Season 1, the return of Ari leading to the two words (\"Sorry, Caitlin\") at the end of Season 2, and the uncovering of Jethro\\'s life story in Season 3.  Season 4 becomes about Jenny\\'s  investigation/obsession, and how it affects the whole office.  It is aninteresting and ominous turn in the series.  It does require the viewer to follow along closely, but in the end, all the main characters find themselves at the center of the puzzle.']\n",

            " ['Just about the time that I thought just about every possible variant on the TV cop/detective/crime solving show had been explored by the creative geniuses who provide our nightly broadcast television ration of pap, piddle and trivia -whoa - here came a show that tickled our Sherlock Holmesian/forensic knowledge fancy.  Whoever would have thought that poking around with microscopes and spectrum analyzers and picking up little bits of fluff at a Los Vegas crime scene with a set of tweezers could be interesting? But yes, it was and has continued to be for going on eight seasons now and has given rise to a couple of variants set in New York and Miami. All three of the CSI iterations offer a distinct challenge to a viewer who possesses a decent ration of curiosity about puzzles and mysteries but a very, very low gross-out threshold. CSI season 7 mercifully let up a little on the really gross visualizations and focused a little more on the puzzles. Nothing I watched this season sent me gagging from the room, so either they let up or I have gotten a little more used to maggoty corpses.Three of the special features in this collection focus specifically on episodes which made season 7 stand a little apart. The first is  a `making of\\'  \"Built to Kill\" a two part episode set backstage at the astonishing Cirque d Soliel, another covers  the definitive stunt-casting of all time;  Roger Daltry playing five different guest parts in \"Living Legend\".  And a third extra feature focused on the hunt for the \"miniature\" killer, which continued intermittently all though the season. I found the \"Miniature Murders\" feature to be especially fascinating, as I had built many inch-to-a-foot scale model interiors and buildings. Having a series of perfectly replicated half-inch-to-a-foot murder scenes showing up within hours of a real, full-sized murder offered a puzzle to Grissom and his crew that lasted all season. Very obviously, it would have taken an artisan of miniatures days and weeks to build such a detailed replica, and the feature made it very clear what a challenge it was, even with the resources available to a television studio. Other extras include commentary tracks for seven episodes, and a tour of the real CSI-Las Vegas offices; which, astonishingly enough, are very much more cluttered and not nearly as plush-looking as the series sets.']\n",

Having said that ...Each season I keep saying the same thing, - this show keeps getting better and better. I feel this show always manages to stay fresh and interesting and I love it more and more with each new season. I can't wait for this release.The first episode in this season is Built To Kill where we are waiting to see more of what we found out in the last episode of season 6 - that Grisolm and Sara had gotten together. My favourite episode is Happenstance where identical twins have been seperately killed and the team try to work out whether the case is related or not. If you want a total recap of each episode then here it goes:Built To Kill 1 - Foul play is suspected when an apparent suicide victim still has the gun in his hand, and a flower delivery woman is found crushed to death in the middle of a Cirque du Soleil performance. (Look for a special appearance from John Mayer.Built To Kill 2 - Grisolm investigates the murder of a rock star, which is complicated by the discovery of a miniature replica of the crime scene at the house. And Catherine tries to determine if she was raped after waking up nude in a seedy hotel.Toe Tags - A group of dead bodies in the Las Vegas morgue get to know each other while CSI tries to solve the crimes that got them there.Fannysmackin' - (another favourite of mine) A gang of street thugs is beating and killing people all over the city. Greg witnesses one of the crimes taking place and becomes a beating victim himself.Double Cross - A lounge singer is found crucified inside a Catholic church, and the church's new pastor fails to disclose that he knows the victim from all the way back to high school.Burn Out - A pedophile arsonist maintains his innocence in the disappearance of two young boys, but he is also willing to help the investigation by giving Grissom insight on the potential kidnapper's mindset.Post Mortem - Greg has his day in court for running over and killing a street gang member right before his own beating, and a second crime scene replica is found--this time after the murder of an elderly woman.Happenstance - CSI investigates the deaths of estranged identical twins: one from a gunshot wound, and one from an apparent suicide. The two deaths do not appear to be related, but are they?Living Legend - (the only boring episode) The team searches for a link between a current string of murders in Las Vegas and a notorious mob boss who disappeared in the 1970s.Loco Motives - Gil finds a third miniature crime-scene replica at a murder site, and CSI tries to find a link between the three otherwise-unrelated murders.Leaving Las Vegas - Catherine tries to link an accused killer to a second similar crime in a small town after he is found not guilty in the first trial, and Gil announces that he is going on sabbatical.Sweet Jane - The C.S.I. team doesn't know what to make of their new member ( Liev Schreiber), who joins them in the hunt for a serial killer, active since the 1970's.Redrum - Keppler proposes that Catherine create a phony crime scene to help catch a murderer, and to keep it secret from the other investigators. However, Nick quickly figures out that something is fishy.Meet Market - The discovery of a badly burned corpse uncovers a plot to illegally harvest bones and tissues, and the death of a middle-aged wife appears to be connected to her relationship with a high-priced male companion.Law Of Gravity - When one Trenton cop is murdered in Las Vegas, a second threatens to expose Keppler's past if he doesn't make the case and the evidence go away.Monster In The Box - Grissom thinks the miniature killer is dead, until he receives another miniature crime scene. However, unlike the others, this one predicts a crime scene that hasn't happened yet.Fallen Idols - A star high school basketball player disappears, and the investigation reveals that he gave an STD to a couple of his classmates.Empty Eyes - Six showgirls who live together are murdered in their home, and Sara is distressed when the final victim dies in her arms. However, she may have left Sara a vital clue that could help her ultimately identify the killer.Big Shots - A death in a drive-by limo shooting and the dragging death of a young woman turn out to be related crimes, and Greg discovers that the brother of the young man he ran over may have been involved.Lab Rats - With Grissom out of his office and all of the detectives out in the field, Hodges and the lab other techs try to discover new clues in the miniature killer case.Ending Happy - A washed-up boxer is found dead at a nearby bordello. There are several suspects, motives, and signs of injury. But the medical examiner is having a hard time figuring out which blow was the actual cause of death.Leapin' Lizzards - CSI discovers that a woman may have been murdered, and her head mounted on a wall as a trophy, because the killer was convinced that she was actually a powerful alien reptile. (Quite a bizzare episode and a bit of a departure from what you're used to seeing on CSI).The Good, The Bad And The Dominatrix - After an unsuccessful attempt on Lady Heather's life, Sara discovers Gil's prior relationship with her. Meanwhile, Nick investigates the death of a woman apparently hit by a taxicab.Living Doll - The miniature killer is ready to strike again, and Sara will be the next victim. Will CSI stop her in time?Throughout the season you see the theme of the miniature killer. It started out slowly and built up speed toward the end. Because of the killer and what he/she has done to Sara, Grisolm ending up blurting out to the others about their relationship. At first the team aren't sure if they heard right or not, but it becomes apparent that they are a couple and that's almost as exciting as working out who's behind these miniatures.If you are a CSI fan, you are bound to love season 7.

So  people do things all the time that don\\'t make any sense even bad cops. So even a strained episode of \"CSI\" is still top rate entertainment.Overall the series was at it\\'s peak during this season and the next.The ninth season is excellent too but long time viewers are without three of their favorite characters.

As the season winds to a close, the CSI's close in on the miniature killer, and the season concludes with one of their lives in jeopardy, and the others desperate to make things right.

I wouldn\\'t worry about any of that if while I were watching it I had enough emotional involvement to care if one of the characters died but after 3 seasons if a main character was killed off I\\'d just wonder how that would change the shows dynamics.One other thing that drive me a bit crazy is that the show acts like the FBI can\\'t even use the bathroom without \"Charlies\" help.

            " ['This was my intoroduction to sci-fi when I was in 2nd grade.  Certain episodes were so vivid that they etched themselves permanently in my memory.  Upon watching them again, I see how they are also emotionally appealing and surprisingly sophisticated, both in their science and in the lack of \"feel good\" deus ex machina endings that mar so many otherwise excellent Star Trek stories.I think by far the best story of this lot is \"The Man Who was Never Born\", which exudes a kind of timeless anguish.  It still moves me to think of the deformed Landau, who was truly brilliant.  But the \"Architects of Fear\" is also wonderful, with the good man sacrificing himself in vain and communicating his love to his wife from his horribly altered form.  They are both tragedies with grand conceptions behind them, truly unique. \"The Galaxy Being\" and \"The Sixth Finger\" are also deeply affecting and believable in their way.  These are all timeless themes in hard sci-fi, done extremely well.There are some bad episodes too, but overall the good ones are worth the price of admission.  I do not see why some reviewers are angry at the format of splitting season 1 into 2 volumes - it doesn\\'t cost more.Warmly recommended as a piece of TV history that still stands on its own as outstanding hard scifi.']\n",

They haven\\'t been enhanced with any thing AND there are no extras. I\\'d average that out to 2 stars for this set.Don\\'t get me wrong--the first season was terrific for the most part. This set (like the first season set) features the moving \"The Man Who Was Never Born\" with Martin Landau as a scarred victim of a viral holocaust who is given the chance to go back in time and prevent the birth of the man who created his sterile world. Featuring a rich score by the late Domninic Frontiere (among his best), this was \"The Outer Limits\" as its best. Also we get \"The Galaxy Being\" with Cliff Roberson who unwittingly brings an alien creature he has been communicating with from a world made of anti-matter into ours causing destruction and death. David McCallum in \"The Sixth Finger\" about the results of an experiment to push humanity to evolve to the next level but how, in the process, we lose the essence of what makes us human.\"The Zanti Misfits\" like much of Stefano\\'s work provides a neat allegory about human nature. We also get \"The Borderlands\" and many other classic episodes mixed with claptrap like \"Human Factor\" but almost everything here is terrific even if we\\'re only getting half a season at a higher price than before.Why not include a commentary track from surviving actors or David J. Suchow the author on the definitive book on \"The Outer Limits\"?

            " ['Dexter Morgan is good at his day job, that of a blood spatter analyst in Miami PD\\'s forensics unit. But he\\'s bloody brilliant at his other job, the one where he gets to murder. Whatever effed up sitch it was that caused Dexter\\'s amnesia regarding his early childhood, it\\'s left him dead inside, an empty shell, a calculating cold fish. He co-exists with something he calls a \"Dark Passenger,\" essentially this urge that compels him to kill and kill. Recognizing the predatory beast inside Dex, his ex-cop foster father, Harry (James Remar), took the boy under his wing, reoriented his twisted appetites to a more productive cause. He instilled in Dex an elaborate code of ethics, taught him to target only other serial killers. He taught Dexter how not to get caught, how to blend in. Dads are awesome. And Dexter has steadfastly abided by the Code of Harry. His kills have been righteous kills.This Showtime adaptation is based on Jeff Lindsay\\'s riveting series of books, and if you haven\\'t read them, well, what\\'s the hold up? Dexter Morgan is so emotionally detached he makes Dr. Temperance Brennan seem positively warm and cuddly. Social cues to which we effortlessly respond are baffling puzzles for him. Perversely, there is something innately likable about Dexter. Michael C. Hall plays him with stunning complexity. It helps that, like in BURN NOTICE, we\\'re privy to his inner musings. Dexter is often humorous and whimsical. The girlfriend (Julie Benz) he pretends to care for doesn\\'t suspect a thing. Even Dexter\\'s jittery, potty-mouthed cop sister, Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), doesn\\'t have an inkling.DEXTER THE FIRST SEASON hooks you in straight away as Dexter finds his bragging rights as Miami\\'s resident monster challenged by an innovative fellow serial killer whom the press eventually dubs the Ice Truck Killer. It\\'s an edgy cat-and-mouse game that would span the entire season and cause Dexter to ask serious questions of himself. The lovely twist is that Dexter accepts the Ice Truck Killer\\'s tauntings with glee, perhaps like calling to like. For Dexter, it\\'s an opportunity to play with someone just like him. Never mind that it\\'s readily apparent that this rival knows everything about Dexter Morgan. Dexter shrugs this off. He\\'s having fun.The Ice Truck Killer\\'s modus operandi is eye-catching. He drains his victims completely of their blood and he freezes the corpses, amputates their limbs to a precise measurement. It\\'s fun - and creepy - watching Dexter try to contain his excitement as each perfect frozen body part surfaces, each bit a gauntlet thrown in Dexter\\'s mug.Most each episode also features a \"serial killer of the week\" motif, some heinous repeat murderer targeted and eventually carved up by Dexter, and these lesser villains are required so that we don\\'t lose faith in Dex as a badasss dude, given his inability to track down the elusive Ice Truck Killer. It\\'s a pretty good supporting cast, too. It wasn\\'t long before I was keen into what these other characters were up to. Jennifer Carpenter is my second favorite actor on this show. She is one sexy, combustible, never-stop-cussing cop chick. But I do question her instincts. She\\'s Miami PD - an ex-Vice, newly minted Homicide Detective - and yet in all these years she hasn\\'t caught a whiff of her adopted brother\\'s true nature? And then she does something else which ends up absolutely mortifying. And then there\\'s Erik King whose angry, loose cannon character, Sgt. Doakes, is the only one who gets the heebie jeebies from Dexter. Doakes bullies Dexter so much, I sort of wish Dexter would just disregard the Code of Harry for once. Except that Dexter remains as cool as the other side of the pillow. He\\'s a monster who\\'s got his priorities straight. You need to not miss this show. It\\'s wicked funny, cleverly written, and terrifically acted (especially by Michael C. Hall). Rife with moral ambivalence, DEXTER rewards its audience with unexpected - and frequently unsettling - moments. And you\\'re hooked before you know it.The DVD set\\'s bonus features:- 2 Audio Commentaries by the Cast & Producers: \"Return to Sender\" (with Jennifer Carpenter, David Zayas, Lauren Velez, and Erik King) and \"Born Free\" (with producers Sara Coleton, Clyde Philips, & Daniel Cerone)- \"The Academy of Blood - A Killer Course\"- \"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation\" - feature on a real-life police investigation in 2001 with particulars on blood spatter analysis- 2 Free Episodes of Showtime\\'s Hit series BROTHERHOOD- A computer-compatible function which allows you to stream two episodes of THE TUDORS, to read the First 2 Chapters of Jeff Lindsay\\'s newest novel DEXTER IN THE DARK, and play the newest CSI Video Game \"CSI: HARD EVIDENCE\"- Cast Biographies']\n",

The Officer adopts the child and takes the opportunity to carefully ingrain in him that he is ONLY to kill others like him...serial killers....who have managed to slip through the system and remain free.  Dexter learns to be one of the best blood spatter experts at the police station.This is extraordinarily interesting as Dexter narrates his inner most thoughts, and we get to learn how a sociopath, with no empathy or understanding of how \"normal\" people feel, navigates through society mimicking how people behave.  That is fascinating.  The acting is dead-on and the writing is crisp and taught.  My ONLY issue with this series is the foul, gutter mouth of Dexter\\'s sister...it is so extreme that it feels like slaps in the face.Really good television.']\n",
            " [\"This concerns only the first season of this series and I know some of the things will not seem right to those who have watched the next seasons. But that is just the point. The first season has characteristics that will change later and the meaning will change too. I will keep within the very limits of that first season. What we gather from the first episodes is that this blood technician working for the Miami PD is the adopted son of a police officer. He was adopted at the age of four by this police officer because he had been traumatized by the killing of his mother with a chain saw by some drug dealers. At once the series insists on the fact that this trauma caused an irreversible damage in the psyche of the child who is fascinated by death and needs killing just like junkies need their drugs. He is addicted to inflicting death to other people. We will only learn quite late in this season who his real father was, after his death actually, so we will never know the man really. We will not be given in this season any detail about the death of the mother beyond what I have said. And all the detail that comes up now and then is always flashbacks in the memory of the child that Dexter was. Dexter recovers that memory little by little just like any child or even adult would do in the case of a traumatic event. His foster father just tried to bring this death impulse of his within some acceptable limits, within a certain code: you can kill but to survive hence you have to kill people who are just plain dirty (I sort of remember this is the code of Anne Rice's vampires). And that's what he has been taught and trained to do. First hide your impulse. Second pick the proper criminals. Third do it so professionally that you can never be suspected. This ideology then is very typical. You can survive any trauma if you know what you are, if you accept what you are and if you find out why you are what your are. When you finally know, then you are clear. The term comes from Hubbard but it is the one that is needed here. It may change later. This concept of clarity is doubled then with the Skinnerian concept of absolute determination of your whole being and future by the mould into which you have been cast in the very first years of your life. In this case, Dexter is a killer because of his trauma that happened when he was four, hence he will be a killer all his life. No one can change that. One can only teach the kid a code, a method, an art to do things along a certain ethical line and not to be caught. That is pessimistic but that is not the main interest of this first season. The main interest is that another serial killer, the Ice Truck Killer, though not being a copy cat, is obviously aiming at this Dexter. And his crimes that are very special in their style, method and delivery are there to titillate Dexter, to chase or bait Dexter into a trap or a corner. Little by little we will learn the connection between the two and that I won't reveal. In the end Dexter will have the upper hand and kill his competitor, along his own method, more or less.  The second interest of this series is how Dexter can keep his secret for himself in his own private life, hiding it from the women he is going along with, from his own sister (foster sister for sure but sister anyway), from his direct colleagues, from his department, etc. It is subtle and difficult and there the actor is doing quite a good job, though the series is more building the meaning with the environment of the character than with the acting of the actor. As usual in American series the actors are rather static and the stage director, the series director and the set designer are building around him or her a composed visual moving environment that builds the meaning of the expression or speech of the actor. Note in this case most of the discourse of the main actor is his own voice over the pictures. He is telling us a story and it is often a commentary of what we can see. The next and essential quality of this series is of course the real artistic and artful suspense that is built in each episode and in the twelve episodes of the season and that lets us absolutely breathless most of the time, even when we finally know who the Ice Truck Killer is, and then the suspense does not go down one iota. In other words this series is so far, first season only, Dionysian, quick, fast, dense, exhilarating, inebriating, intoxicating and many other things of that sort. In one word it is addictive and habit forming. You may, if you have ten hours and a half at your disposal watch the twelve episodes in one go and you will never be bored, tired, de-concentrated. Try it and you will like it I am sure.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID\"]\n",

Too much of the time he blends in so much you forget all about it, then you have to be reminded by forced voice overs and flashbacks.  This is a good DVD set though, I see lots of folks complaining about the transfer.  What can I say, don't spend 50 zillion bucks on your TV/Home theatre and you won't be so disappointed.  For 20 bones you get 12 doses of Dexter, AND two episodes of Brotherhood, and one of The Tudors if you have the time to screw around with the PC feature.

The TV version fleshes out the other characters, such as Rita. the girlfriend and the police lieutenant, La Guerta  and introduces a new character in the person of Esme. The book is an intense ride within Dexter\\'s mind with a focus on his relationship with his Dark Passenger. The details of his relationships with other humans are not as detailed as in the series.Having said this, I highly recommend both. It will be interesting to see how Showtime adapts the second novel.I think Showtime has done a great job of casting in this series. I remember Michael Hall from \"Six Feet Under\" and I think he makes a perfect Dexter.Also, CBS is now showing Showtime\\'s Dexter on Sunday evenings at 10 pm.

It is similar to the way the dark parts of paintings illuminate the light, each complimenting the other.

I'm not crazy about any of the acting here except Hall's, but he's flawless throughout, bringing a subtlety that few actors on the big or small screens ever master to this degree.Nearly every episode is well-written, paced, and directed; the season arc is a good one and plays out nicely, no need for spoilers here!It does get a little gory at times, but the series is about a serial killer, after all. I have some very queasy thoughts about why a series this twisted is so popular, but I guess it's just another Clint-type revenge drama where psychopathic violence is justified by (a vaguely) moral imperative; we do need our foreign policy to start somewhere.Hall is even better here than in Six Feet Under, where he was superb. He carries Dexter effortlessly on his shoulders, but one can feel the amount of work and care he's put into this role. It's as impressive as Gandolfini's Tony Soprano, and that's saying a lot. As is usual for most of the best cable dramas, the first season seems to be the best, so savor this one if watching it for the first time.Miami hasn't looked this good and this bad since Michael Mann was in town.\"]\n",

How does he really feel about himself?  At the time we are exploring the story, Dexter is evolving from a character who states he lacks human feeling to someone who seems to feel more and more with each passing day (or episode).  The show is brilliantly done.  I've read the book and it is a pretty straight forward story.  To build the story up, the writers of the show build up the characters and made them even deeper characters.  I am just so impressed with the work.  They can even make me angry because I'm so involved and one of my major characters is affected in some way.  I am attracted to Dexter and repelled by him at the same time.\"]\n",

            " ['Television has been called a vast wasteland. I\\'ve heard people rant and rave for years about having so many channels and nothing to watch on TV. And then I started looking at two things. The first was my television watching schedule which has actually begun cutting into my DVD watching schedule (so little time, so much to watch). Then I looked at my shelving unit and noticed the number of TV series collections there. People are wrong. There is plenty good to watch on TV. And DEXTER is an example of it.For those who aren\\'t aware, DEXTER is a series on Showtime, so many of you might not have seen it. If that\\'s the case you\\'re in luck because the series has been released on DVD. While season two has just hit shelves in blu-ray format, the focus here is season one.Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is a forensics blood splatter expert for the Miami police department. His job is to help collect and understand evidence found at the scene of a crime that involves blood and blood splatter patterns. Oh, and on the side, Dexter is a serial killer.Stay with me here because he\\'s not a bad guy really. Well...then again maybe he is. After all he is a murderer multiple times over. The difference is that Dexter only kills bad guys. Dexter kills murderers, pedophiles, arsonists and the like that got off due to some technicality. But he always verifies that they were guilty before taking them out of the picture.Dexter\\'s foster father Harry (James Remar) was a police man who found Dexter at the scene of a crime before adopting him. Harry recognized the killing instinct found in Dexter at an early age so he helped him to channel that, to use rules that he established for Dexter, to get through life. And via Harry\\'s rules, Dexter now kills bad guys using his job as a means to find just the right victims.So there is the basic set up for the series. But it\\'s so much more than that, filled with layer upon layer of subtext and inner meaning that is revealed as the series progresses.Season one focuses first on letting us know who Dexter is and who the surrounding cast of characters involved with him are. First off is his sister Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), a seemingly spastic patrol officer dying to become a homicide detective. Deb\\'s enthusiasm for the job is off set by her self deprecating ways and the giddiness she exhibits for all things.At the stations there are two main characters who affect Dexter. The first is Lt. Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez) his direct supervisor who at times seems to have a personal interest in Dexter. A woman who\\'s made it where she is by hard work, she has a storyline of her own involving police office politics as the series progresses.The second is Sgt. James Doakes (Eric King), Dexter\\'s apparent nemesis. Doakes is a hard boiled cop from top to bottom, a no nonsense sort who wants answer and wants them now. Doakes is constantly badgering Dexter, offering everything from name calling to in your face attitude. One would think that eventually the two of them would reach a point where there wouldn\\'t be room for both of them in Miami. One would think.Along with these major players there is an assortment of cast members in the squad who round out the ensemble in the best way possible. And each gets enough screen time in season one to make them a character to care about. The interaction between them on a personal level comes into play as the layers of Dexter unravel.On the personal side, Dexter actually has a girlfriend. Normal on the outside, but not within. It seems Dexter has taken her as his girlfriend to help appear normal. It is through his thoughts (voice over into Dexter\\'s mind runs throughout the series) concerning her that he lets us know he is devoid of emotion, that he has no feelings. His involvement with her is purely as a means to offer him cover.Rita (Julie Bienz) is a battered wife, or at least she was. Dexter\\'s sister was on call when her ex was arrested. Paul, her ex, was a wife beater extreme and a drug user to boot. Now in prison, he gets release part way into season one and a subplot here involving him trying to reinsert himself into his family\\'s life crosses Dexter\\'s life as well.With characters and plot lines established, you would expect the series to kick off with Dexter showing what he can do. Instead, Dexter finds himself in a competition of sorts when a new serial killer hits Miami. And this killer is leaving calling cards that Dexter not only finds discomforting but amazing as well. He\\'s impressed with the style and artistic ability of the killer who leaves his victims in pieces and drained of blood.As each episode continues the tale, we find that this new killer referred to as the Ice Truck Killer (when it\\'s discovered that he uses one to haul victims from their murder location to where he leaves their bodies) knows something about Dexter. He leaves small clues at first for Dexter to find. Eventually he leaves Polaroid\\'s of Dexter\\'s past as well. It seems that the perfect serial killer is being stalked by his own serial killer.Season one not only defines who the character of Dexter is it offers the world he lives in and tosses in his biggest match to boot. How Dexter became who he is and what influences him is told in flashback. His motivations are shown by the end of this season as is the identity of the Ice Truck Killer. But will that change who Dexter is? Doubtful since season four begins soon.What makes this show so unique is that it combines one of the most frightening characters one can imagine, a soul less who cares serial killer, with one of the wittiest funny line spouting people seen on TV. Dexter tosses off subtle one liners non-stop and each one offers a glimpse behind the mask and a laugh as well.But the amazing thing is that not only do we find ourselves repulsed and attracted to the same character, we find in the writing that there is more to him than is even he realizes. The character of Dexter may think he possesses no emotions whatsoever but his emotions run deeper than he realizes. And it seems as though his journey of self revelation may be what\\'s driving the series forward in later seasons.Also Dexter offers something that many of us would never want to admit we seek. An avenging angel out there doing what so many would love to know is going on but at the same time turn their head and condemn on the outside. Like Jack Bauer of \"24\", a hero who uses tactics we claim to hate while hoping someone like him exists to protect us, Dexter is the privately admired solution for those who feel that the worst of criminals are let lose on technicalities. We would fear someone like Dexter while at the same time would love to see someone who doesn\\'t let the bad guy get away with murder. Even though this is what Dexter does, murder.There is no way to offer up in this short space just what it is that Dexter is about. Police procedural. Police politics. Serial killer. Murder mystery. Family complexities. Killing tutorial. Hilarious dark comedy. All are a part of Dexter and all come together in a fantastic package.If you\\'re not afraid to try something a little different, then you need to give Dexter a try. I know the season one set I watch belonged to my son. After watching I intend to get a copy of my own. And to continue with it down the line. I\\'m already hard at work watching season two on blu-ray to write about. Unusual, quirky, off beat, scary, normal...all are words that define Dexter. And yet none can explain what this series is all about. Watch and see.']\n",

            " ['Wow! I finally watched my very first episode of \"Dexter\" last weekend, and I ended up finishing Season 1 in its entirety within a few days. This is an amazing show about Dexter (Michael C. Hall), a Miami-based forensics experts who also happens to be a serial killer. However, Dexter is a NICE serial killer in that he has a strict moral code that he always adheres to: He only kills people who are violent criminals themselves and deserve to be punished. The first season of \"Dexter\" revolves around another serial killer that\\'s been terrorizing the state of Florida. The Ice Truck Killer has a nasty habit of murdering prostitutes, cutting them up into pieces, and arranging their bodies artfully in very public places. Dexter works with members of the police department, including his adopted sister, Deb (Jennifer Carter), to find the killer. However, Dexter can\\'t help being fascinated by the Ice Truck Killer\\'s meticulous technique. He soon begins communicating with the killer, who seems to have an uncanny connection to Dexter and starts using his murders to trigger painful, repressed memories from Dexter\\'s past.I became hooked on this show very quickly. Hall is amazing as Dexter, who is probably one of the most complex characters in television history. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Carter, Erik King as Sergeant Doakes (the only person who suspects Dexter of any wrongdoing), and James Remar, who portrays Dexter\\'s father in flashbacks. I\\'m not particularly fond of Rita\\'s character (portrayed by Julie Benz). She\\'s incredibly wishy-washy, but I can definitely see why Dexter was drawn to someone with her personality. I also think the whole Ice Truck Killer identity revelation, intriguing as it was, could have been a bit less obvious. (I figured out his real identity and true connection to Dexter right away, so either the story was a bit too predictable or I am just incredibly brilliant.)Overall, though, \"Dexter\" is a very unique and compelling show. I have no idea how the program will manage to surpass its first season, but I can\\'t wait to find out.']\n",
            " [\"I had never seen Dexter before not having showtime but after seeing the show on a regular station I was hooked and ordered the first season,loved it and am waiting for the second season which I ordered to ship.

            " [\"Sometimes I find connections to Hollywood in the strangest places.  In the case of Dexter, it was at my day job. Now my office job is not normally the place one associates with a show like Dexter, but it turns out that the sister of the guy I worked with worked on the show. The fact that the show is on Showtime and thus can portray gore and violence as appropriate to the medium (like HBO's Rome, for example) piqued my curiosity. Unfortunately, it took me over a year to actually view season one.  I'm sorry I waited so long.I've done enough research on serial killers (and their fictional cousin, slashers) to know that they're easy to mess up.  And an entire season about a serial killer from the serial killer's perspective is fraught with peril. Fortunately, Dexter hits all the right notes to keep an audience engaged for the entire season.Dexter Mogran (Michael C. Hall) is a serial killer with a cause.  His father, Harry (James Remar) recognized his adopted son's homicidal tendencies and trained him to stalk the most despicable of prey.  These were the lowest of the low, the scum that Harry in his job as a cop saw frequently escape justice.  Dexter became a Final Solution of sorts, eliminating people neatly and efficiently while at the same time fulfilling insatiable desire for bloodshed.  Literally.In his day job, Dexter is a blood spatter analyst.  He works side-by-side with his adopted sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), probably the most annoying character in the show.  And yet, she's annoying on purpose - her frail, waif-like reactions to men and the rigors of her job make her alternately pathetic and vulnerable, feral and misguided.  In short, she needs Dexter's calm, creepy presence. Rounding out the cast is career-climbing Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez), coworkers Angel Batista (David Zayas) and Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee, formerly of the show Chuck) and my favorite character, foul-mouthed Sergeant James Doakes (Erik King).  Doakes is the only person who sees Dexter for what he is, but he can't prove it.Dexter feigns a personal life as well.  He has a girlfriend, Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), whose last relationship was so emotionally scarring that she fears intimacy, which suits Dexter just fine.  Indeed, all of Dexter's life is an act, from the jokes he cracks to the donuts he brings to the pleasantries he exchanges with Rita.  He's a monster masquerading as a person, and the only reason it's not more obvious is because everyone else has more pressing problems.Dexter's job puts him in a unique position to both appreciate the art of the kill and find new victims. Despite his penchant for murdering his victims, Dexter's murders are relatively clean - he drains his victims of blood, hacks the pieces up, and tosses them into the ocean.  And so it goes: find some sleazeball who escaped justice, kidnap him or her, murder, dump the body, repeat. Until one day, another serial killer who seems to know intimate details about Dexter's past begins sending messages through his own unique style of doll-like murders.The ending of season one won't be a shock to observant viewers.  It's not the actual ending that matters but the journey getting there. Dexter's narration is amusing and wry, his cadence just off enough that he comes across as disturbed yet functional. Surprisingly, the show isn't very gory at all.  Dexter would probably be less sympathetic if we were subjected to every grisly detail.  In fact, by cutting away from the most gruesome scenes, Dexter has to remind us that he's one of the bad guys - the Code of Harry is as much the anti-hero's code that we see in a multitude of other crime-fighting shows.  It's a credit to the writers that Dexter is both a monstrous, damaged human being and yet still human.Can't wait for season two!\"]\n",

            " [\"Dexter has finally made his Blu-Ray debut, and the glossy, well-made series looks wonderful in the format.  Besides some relatively small BD-Live features (including seeing the first episode the third season), there really isn't anything here that wasn't on the standard-def version of the Complete First Season, but for Blu-Ray owners who haven't taken the plunge into Dexter's world, this is definitely worth checking out.  Below is my original review for first season.The interesting concept of this Showtime series makes it reason enough to check it out.  Michael C. Hall (Six Feet Under) plays the title character, who works in forensics for the Florida police by day, and is a serial killer at night. Because of his job and upbringing by a police officer foster father (James Remar), Dexter knows how to cover his tracks while wearing his mask of humanity by day.  Slowly though, things start to take a turn when another serial killer with connections to Dexter's own mysterious past rears his head, and soon enough our title character is caught in a bloody game of cat and mouse.  What makes Dexter so good is the approach taken to the theme of the series by the creators and Hall himself.  What could have easily flopped and failed miserably instead evolves episode by episode as we attempt to see what makes Dexter tick.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well to say the least. Julie Benz (the vampiric Darla from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) is superb as Rita: Dexter's rape victim girlfriend whom he keeps around so he doesn't have to bother with sex, HBO's Oz veterans Lauren Velez and David Zayas as fellow cops, and hottie Jennifer Carpenter (whom Hall has recently married, seriously) as Dexter's sister.  Not since Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer has there been an interesting and above all chilling glimpse into the mind of a madman that walks among us.  Spectacular, and definitely worth picking up even if you never caught the show on Showtime during it's first season run.\"]\n",

The setting of post-Miami-Vice Miami is a visually interesting backdrop - although a little too much at times.

Other times, it's about a man who has no feelings but shows emotions like anger, frustration and fear. Oh, and there's the relationship between the main character and his damaged girlfriend. Who he feels is as damaged as he is. Now, I do hope these are not considered spoilers, as they are the central focus of the series it seems. There are more things going on in the series, such as his past relationship with his foster father, he relationship with his foster sister, his relationship with his coworkers etc. At this time, I can see the character developing into a very interesting but bizarre person. And of course the series will follow suit. We hope. After all, I have 6 seasons to watch. Can I recommend this series, sort of. I am not quite certain it is for everyone. It's growing on me though.

            " ['I guess my biggest complaint about DEXTER is that it isn\\'t nasty ENOUGH.  The premise if phenomenal...Dexter is a blood-spatter expert investigating murders by day and a murdered of killers by night.  By channeling his impulses to kill in a \"helpful\" way...he is actually a hero.  I know, I know, anyone who kills is bad...but seriously, the people Dexter knocks off are mostly brutal serial-killers themselves...killers who knock off children and other innocents.  Dexter is doing the world a favor.  And that\\'s the problem...he is so meticulous in who he kills that his dark side is really never more than a naughty wink.  There\\'s no real ethical dilemma for the viewer in rooting for Dexter.But don\\'t get me wrong...the show is a blast nonetheless.  From it\\'s super-saturated Florida colors, to its sly & witty narration, the show is top-notch and very entertaining.  Michael C. Hall is perfect as DEXTER.  While his performance isn\\'t exactly a tour-de-force of evil (like Anthony Hopkins in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, for example)...it is a lovely, inventive performance.  He brings nuance to the role of a guy who has to fake smiling...and because we know he\\'s faking, we\\'re kinda in on the joke.  We can be \"amused\" along with Dexter at his ability to fool most of society into liking him.The only true \"dark side\" to Dexter is his inability to love.  He has a girlfriend, but only to help himself look normal.  He is very good to her and her kids, and the poor girl (damaged from a previous, abusive marriage) just adores Dexter in return.  But he doesn\\'t really have feelings for her, and this colors all their scenes together.  This is the ethical quandary that I wish Dexter\\'s killings also had.The other thing I really like about the show are the flashbacks, showing Dexter being raised and groomed for his work by a very understanding foster father, who happens to be a cop.  James Remar plays this part so well...it\\'s probably the best role this long-time character actor has ever had.  It\\'s a small part, but he brings great strength to it.  And great love and concern for Dexter.  You always hear that parents will do ANYTHING to protect their kids...Remar\\'s character is the ultimate example of this.Also, the opening credits of the show are AWESOME!!  Creepy and clever.So, while the show, to me, isn\\'t perfect (I would prefer it a little darker), it is still HUGELY entertaining, well-acted by its lead and well-filmed for a relatively low budget.

            " [\"A Showtime production, Dexter is an anomaly.  It is a brilliantly written, intriguing, and totally engrossing series, that is seldom predictable.  Besides a compelling storyline, and characters that seem real, what makes the series even more unique, is that the protagonist, Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a blood spatter expert for the Miami police, is a cold blooded murderer.Hall's unusual role is the key to the series, and his performance is a riveting, and captivating character study, that makes Dexter a very hard show to turn away from.  Morgan is guided by the `Code of Harry'.  Harry (James Remar) was Dexter's adoptive father, an ex-cop who recognized that his traumatized son, had homicidal tendencies.  To help him survive, Harry trained Dexter to channel his desire to kill in a 'positive' direction, by instilling the directive to kill only those who truly deserve to die.  This twisted morality is quite bizarre, and makes for fascinating viewing, as Dexter kills ceremoniously.Presumably to contain any spilled blood, plastic sheeting is typically spread all around the area, and Dexter himself is also covered with plastic sheeting.  Victims are taped down naked to a table top face up, helpless and unable to move.  After drawing a blood sample for his collection, Dexter gets to work.  The dead body is chopped into pieces, and the remains placed in trash bags.  Few of the grisly details are actually shown, but the presentation is still pretty chilling.  The series has a wicked sense of humor, as Dexter discusses his thoughts through narration, as he nonchalantly goes about his business, which includes murder.  Harry is dead, but appears frequently, in flashbacks.  Harry's biological daughter Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), also works for the Miami PD in homicide.  She is eager, enthusiastic, loves to swear, and has a problem with authority.The twelve episodes play like a chapters in a book.  Unlike most weekly series, the format does not always involve solving a particular case within the episode.  Instead, the story unfolds broadly and more naturally, with information about Dexter and his past, coming in small bits.  Dexter is dealing with coming to terms with his emotions, or lack thereof, and watching how this affects the evolution of his relationship with his girlfriend Rita (Julie Benz), is fascinating.  Benz's performance is pretty amazing, playing an abused woman trying to start a new relationship.The central underlying story concerns a serial killer known as `Ice Truck Killer', who specializes in neatly slicing up his victim's bodies into bloodless pieces.  The whole concept is diabolically macabre, and well executed.  The killer has taken a special interest in Dexter, and tension and suspense grows more intense, after the killer's identity is revealed with a few episodes left to go.  The killer has an elaborate plan, though he is forced to improvise when the pursuit begins to close in.  As Dexter begins to recall the horrific circumstances surrounding his mother's death, the killer makes his play.  The writing is outstanding, and keeps you off balance.  Approaching the conclusion, things get a little shaky in the turn, but control is reacquired, and Dexter finishes wildly and dramatically, with a stylistic flourish that does not cheat the viewer.Dexter is refreshingly different from most forensic procedurals.  Although dealing with violence and death, there isn't a lot of fighting, shootouts, or chases.  The focus is on character and story development.  While there are things that go over the top, or are illogical, unlike programs like the CSI franchise, the level of drama isn't routinely pumped up by threats, flashy violence, condescending dialog, or music.  The police in Dexter work `normally', with no overly dramatic background music, while routine tasks like, processing the crime scene, performing tests, or analyzing evidence take place.  The level of acting by almost everyone involved is excellent, from the minor characters to the leads.  The writing is not perfect, but the characters and their dialog, are mostly credible, showing the audience some respect.  There are no long winded pretentious speeches sprouting psychobabble, phony overdramatic situations, and characters trying to top each other, or engaging in supercop behavior.  Criminal Minds or CSI Miami, this is not.The series is far from perfect, and doesn't escape being ridiculous.  While a darkened room, draped with plastic sheeting, with a naked victim tapped down helpless, is a terrifying scene, it makes little sense, unless Dexter has giant rolls of plastic sheeting, and maybe a case of packing tape in his car.  The time it would take to actually prepare the scene, and put up all that sheeting would be ridiculous.  Tape and plastic sheeting are excellent for retaining evidence like fingerprints, would have to be destroyed.  Dexter disposes a couple of bags of body parts per kill, but what happens to all that tape and plastic sheeting?  Over the course of the season, Dexter takes chances, makes mistakes, and has several close calls, and is clearly under suspicion, at the conclusion, setting the stage for the next season.One of the few negatives is the lack of subtitles, and the inappropriateness of the extras.  Two episodes have commentary tracks, but some of the other bonus materials, are not directly related to the series.  The mini-documentary Witnessed in Blood, covers the forensics for an unrelated criminal case.  And two episodes of Showtime's series Brotherhood are included, presumably as an attempt to promote that series.  More material specifically relevant to Dexter, would certainly have been preferred.  Otherwise, needless to say, the series is highly recommended to fans of the forensic crime genre.\"]\n",

This is not a defense of Dex, just a clarification.What makes him even more complex is that he did not suffer abuse at the hands of his loving foster parents; he maintains a good relationship with his sister, a cop; he works as a forensic examiner for the police; he fakes emotions as best he can with  his girlfriend and her kids; and feels nothing at all, most of the time, unless it's a sense that he must get rid of someone.Michael C.

            " ['If you\\'re reading this you either are 1) a fan of the show 2) want to know more about it to see if it will appeal to you. Michael C. Hall (\"Six Feet Under\") plays Dexter a vigilante serial killer. By day Dexter works as a splatter analyst in the police department using blood patterns to help determine exactly how a crime occurred.We have a true anti-hero as the focus of the series--a serial killer who almost seems to have a conscience because he focuses on dealing out justice (and focusing his urges)to those he feels are evil. His father a police officer instilled a code to help him direct his \"urges\" and distinguish between good and evil.Showtime has attempted to improve the quality of their shows and their DVD releases with some mixed results. I found the image quality to be anything but subpar for a DVD. It\\'s a very good transfer. Is it high definition? No, but this isn\\'t an HD-DVD and the quality for a standard DVD is very good although there are some digital compression issues that crop up occasionally.The one complaint I have is simple--no chapter indexing where you can see specific scenes for each episode. Sure you can skip through it by hitting the next button but it\\'s kind of unusual in this day and age for new shows to NOT have this. The second is minor and others have pointed it out--the menu is a very basic design that looks like it could have been done by an amateur.You also have to reset audio for each disc as you watch it for 5.1 as it automatically defaults to 2.o. To be sure many of these are minor points but they do contribute to the enjoyment of the show if handled well.The special features are an improvement over some previous Showtime series but far from perfect. We get two episodes of the excellent Showtime drama \"Brotherhood\". We also get \"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation\" a very good featurette that focuses on splatter analysis and what it reveals about a murder. It ties in to \"Dexter\" because that\\'s what Dexter does for a living on the show and it also helps him to break a number of cases. We also get a commentary track that I haven\\'t listened to yet as well as an online link to watch two episodes of the new Showtime series \"The Tudors\" and a pdf file with the first two chapters of the new Dexter novel. I suspect that \"The Academy of Blood: A Killer Course\" is along with the DEXTER novel excerpt buried in the DVD-Rom portion of the disc. You won\\'t be able to watch it or access it on a regular DVD player which is just plain sloppy as this isn\\'t indicated on the package.We also get biographies for the actors. While the extras here (including two commentary tracks on the set are very good, the show could have used more commentary tracks and the involvement of star Michael C. Hall on at least one of them. Also, the special features really need to be more clearly indicated as to whether they are DVD accessible, PC accessible and where you might find them on the disc.Minor Plot Spoilers:Dexter\\'s father a police officer recognized early on his son\\'s proclivities and tried to give him moral guidence and boundaries so that he can function in our world but, more importantly, use his \"skills\" to hunt down those that prey on others.Dexter is conflicted--he knows that he\\'s not normal and he also knows he doesn\\'t fit in (he has difficulty with emotions having to fake his way through it). He also recognizes what he is and how his father tried to shape him into something \"better\".When he goes toe-to-toe with the Ice Truck Murderer and tries to track down this nasty serial killer he gets a glimpse into his own soul but also recognizes that unlike his evil doppleganger he can choose his actions and not just act on his instincts.END OF PLOT SPOILERS:Overall, Dexter is a terrific show. The second season has also gotten off to a bold start. The first season used the novel DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER as a starting point. For the second season the writers/producers have chosen to depart from the novels which should make for an interesting move. This is a solid set that could be improved with future seasons.']\n",
            " ['\"Dexter\" is built on an intriguing premise: a man with antisocial personality disorder experiences murderous impulses but lives by a code - he can only kill murderers.  Kind of a twisted play on Freud\\'s concept of sublimation.  The series didn\\'t initially appeal to me, but overall I\\'m pleased that I stuck with the first season.  Michael C. Hall plays the titular character, a forensic expert in blood splatter.  He works alongside a group of detectives assigned to some of most brutal Miami murders; one of these cops is Dexter\\'s adopted sister, Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter).  Dexter was adopted as a child by a Miami cop (the now deceased Harry Morgan) who recognized that Dexter was antisocial.  Instead of allowing Dexter to go down the path of juvenile delinquency (and inevitably murder), Harry developed a code for him - you can kill but only under certain circumstances.  Harry also encouraged Dexter to do things to make him seem normal, such as dating, to help him hide his true nature and go undetected.  Most episodes feature Dexter stalking a serial killer, with a season long plot involving Dexter\\'s fascination with the \"Ice Truck Killer.\"The series features excellent writing and direction, which helps make the somewhat unbelievable premise feel realistic.  The acting also is top-notch.  Hall does a nice job of making Dexter charming and likeable (so that we can believe that he can fit in at work and his relationships) while also adding a bit of edge through his lack of true emotion, superficial charm, and violent impulses.  We can sense that evil lurks just below the surface, kept in check only by his adherence to his code.  It\\'s a solid portrayal of an extreme case of antisocial personality disorder, and the series isn\\'t afraid to make its protagonist dark and somewhat frightening.  The supporting cast is also terrific, with C.S. Lee scoring as Vince Masuka, Dexter\\'s lascivious co-worker who is a walking sexual harassment case.  Likewise, Sgt. Doakes (Erik King) helps lighten the mood as the only person who seems to know that Dexter is not the good guy he portrays.  I also enjoy the work of two \"Oz\" veterans - Lauren Velez as Dexter\\'s complicated Lieutenant, and David Zayas as Detective Angel Batista (perhaps Dexter\\'s closest \"friend\").Although I enjoyed the show, there were a few things I disliked about the first season.  Debra\\'s insecurity is highly grating, and the actress gives a twitchy, affected performance.  Dexter\\'s flashbacks to his days with Harry become extremely repetitive and unrealistic after awhile.  The first few episodes were difficult to watch, and Dexter came across as quite brutal; I was ready to give up on the series after these shows, but the character became more \"human\" in subsequent episodes.  Finally, the last two episodes of the season, which focused on the Ice Truck Killer case, were overly melodramatic and lead to a rather unsatisfying ending.  Although I approached the series with some trepidation and found it flawed, there\\'s enough to like about the Season 1 that I plan on watching Season 2 on DVD.']\n",

            " [\"This structured media wiring enclosure is made of a composite instead of the more traditional metal cases from leviton or other manufacturers on the market.  The goal of this construction is to enable the homeowner to keep your main home gateway router and wireless access point inside the enclosure without having signals impacted by the enclosure material.  And it works as advertised.The enclosure is 35&#34;x20&#34;x5&#34; with stud 'wings for easy mounting.  The depth of the unit is designed for a traditional 2x4 wall construction with finished drywall, sitting proud with the door and flange covering the rough opening in the drywall.  While this is best situated for installation before your drywall is in, its theoretically possible to do a retrofit install, providing your electrical and low voltage wiring is roughed in and you've allowed for the 20&#34; width.As expected it works with the Leviton media panel modules for low voltage terminations and the surge suppressor punch outs for single and multiple outlets for running switches or other devices in the enclosure.  While the design of this enclosure is meant for running a router/AP inside with flow through venting in the door, you may want to make sure your devices are not running hot.  The natural flow of heat out at the top should pull in cool air in the bottom vents with convection, you may wish to plan for a intake fan.  YMMV.  I've just used mine for wire termination and management.Solid product line, fit for use, and removes the &#34;ugly&#34; when in a finished space.\"]\n",

Don\\'t drop it or get too rough with it or it will likely crack. When mounting, you will need to make sure it stays square otherwise the door won\\'t fit.-The door closes with plastic, click-lock, tension tabs which may not be that durable over time especially if you plan to access the panel frequently. My history with plastic tabs is that they generally crack or break at some point. The door is not lockable in case you need that feature.Overall, this is a decent media enclosure that doesn\\'t have the greatest build quality but should be fine for low-access use. If you have a bigger project, need more venting, or need frequent access, you should skip this and consider a rack setup.The mounting holes are 16\" apart so make sure your studs will accommodate this.']\n",

            " ['This media enclosure made of flame-retardant acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) polymer and is radio frequency (RF) transparent to accommodate wireless devices whose signals would be blocked by traditional metal enclosures. The purpose of this particular product is to enclose wireless devices without impeding their signals.In my garage the TV and Internet wires converge into a metal media enclosure box which made for a neat accessible system behind a closed door. However, to add wireless capability, the devices cannot be enclosed in a metal box and function, so I had to locate them inside the house so that phones, tablets, and other devices could connect.This entailed an additional cable with a splitter being connected to the existing cable connection with the device being in plain sight.  A power cable was required, along with five network cables. This is the opposite of a neat, accessible system.This Structured Media Enclosure is a solution for the problem and can be installed between the wall studs in an area where the wireless device inside can provide a signal with adequate dispersion throughout the house. It is better if this can be done when the house is being built, but it can also be retro-fitted into an existing structure which is what I am doing.Wireless home technology presents another problem for placement of the box. Most wireless manufacturers and experts on the web suggest that the wireless router or access point be placed higher than the equipment in use. This makes the traditional placement of network closets a potential problem, particularly if the location is in the basement.If the enclosure is being installed during construction, this is less of an issue if a location can be found at least 5 feet above the top floor of the house, such as in a closet, attic, garage, etc. Obviously, in an existing structure, this may be difficult.Transmitting WiFi signals through multiple walls and floors, as well as metal structures will cause weakening of the signal, as will the presence of other radio frequency devices such as wireless phones, baby monitors, etc. The best way to insure the placement will work is to temporarily install the functioning wireless source device at the planned location and try to connect from all of the locations that are likely to be needed.In my case, the old media box is mounted between the studs with the top edge about 6 feet high on the shared wall between the garage and the single story house. The Internet and Cable TV enters on one side of the box through a cutout and connects through splitters to 6 wires that exit the box through conduits leading to wall plates in the house.Currently, my wireless equipment is located in another room, connected to one of the wall plates. I checked to see if I could install the new media structure where the old one is by connecting the current router there and then checking the connection throughout the house with my laptop.  The signal was acceptable throughout, but may require a network extender in the furthest room.When mounting the Structured Media Enclosure, the flange surrounding the provided door covered any uneven fit between the enclosure and the wall with its 2.25 inch overlap. It also covered the cuts in the drywall, necessary to mount it between the studs. The door swings open 180 degrees to provide excellent access, and includes air vents to aid in dissipating any heat generated by the wireless equipment inside.Only complaint is that the unit seems somewhat insubstantial - even allowing for the necessity of it being a non-metal structure to permit WiFi. The box does not lock, but then neither did the one it replaced.']\n",
            " [\"I've installed several Leviton structured media enclosures before, but this is my first plastic enclosure. I'm a huge fan of Leviton's structured media systems, especially their metal enclosures as they're extremely durable, easy to install, and they look great. I got this particular unit for my home... since moving in years ago I haven't installed a media enclosure, but have have been redoing all of the house's wiring and running them to a central location, and using Leviton structured media devices.This plastic enclosure is said to be less restrictive to WiFi signals then the regular metal enclosures. This would only apply to you if you used a WiFi transmitter or router within this unit.My biggest complaint with this unit is the installation... the metal Leviton flush-mount enclosures simply require you to cut a hole in the drywall the size of the box, slide it into the hole, and put screws into the studs through the side of the enclosure. The door or cover panel hides the rough drywall cutout, so no further damage to the wall is necessary. How complicated it is beyond that depends on your wiring. This new plastic unit is different in that mounting screws are expected to be installed from the front through flanges. That's fine for a new home, but for remodeling, you'll need to remove more drywall to access the studs. The door cover is wide enough to mask the larger hole made in the drywall, however without drywall behind the entire door frame, you have to be very careful when installing the door frame's screws... screw them in just a bit too far and you can bend or break the plastic frame. Screw them in just enough and the door frame doesn't feel 100% secure and can move a bit. I ended up placing strips of drywall on the studs (but not over the flanges since they're 1/8&#34; thick and would have caused the drywall to bulge). This way I was able to tighten the door frame down a bit more securely.My second complaint is the door itself. The metal doors have a single latch that solidly keeps the door shut. This plastic model has two clasps that rely on the spring tension of the plastic. The plastic on the door barely catches the plastic on the frame, at least on my enclosure. As a matter of fact, I had to push the frame together as I was screwing the door frame in place, otherwise the top clasp would not have caught the frame at all. If I were to pull on the door without releasing the clasps first, I could easily break the clasps as there's not much plastic contacting the frame. Nothing like the secure latch on the metal enclosures.Aside from installation, the enclosure works fine. I noticed no loss of signal at all from my wireless router since placing it in the enclosure. All my Leviton devices, both old and new, fit perfectly. Even non-Leviton devices can easily be mounted within the unit. There are several pop-out along the top of the enclosure for running wires, as well as a couple more along the bottom and two pop-outs for placing outlet boxes. Regular metal outlet boxes work fine with this unit.Overall, installation is a bit more complicated then any other Leviton media enclosure I've installed, and the plastic door could be made much better, especially considering the price of this unit. If you don't plan to use a wireless device within the enclosure I would strongly recommend looking into Leviton's metal media enclosures. They are far better in nearly every way and easier to install.\"]\n",

It does make a nice nightlight.* The speaker is capable of filling a reasonable sized room with sound slightly above the level of conversation.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* The sound quality is pretty bad. There is no bass, no treble, and the midrange is muddled and easily distorts. The $15 speakers I use on my computer generate a comparable sound. There is a slight stereo separation, but certainly could be better.* The light show gets boring pretty quick. It is not in any way tied to the music, just sequence of colors. They are not all that bright-maybe the equivalent of a couple of LED Christmas lights. The unit is not exactly aesthetic- it very much reminds me of a giant version of an electric pencil sharpener.* The electronics are a joke. The power plug falls out just be looking at it, and the switches have some strange functions. The unit won't play anything unless the bluetooth switch is ON, even if you are using the aux input. The power switch seems to have some connection to the lights, I think.* There is no muting on the inputs, meaning that if you have the speaker powered up and no input signal, it will magnify whatever noise it can find.* The bluetooth connection is questionable. I use my iPhone to source music to bluetooth speakers all the time with no problem-but with this unit I had signal dropout from three feet away.=== Summary ===I don't get it. The sound quality is pretty bad, the light show is disappointing, and the quality of the unit itself is questionable. I can't imagine anyone being happy with it.

I also hooked the speaker up to my six or seven year old MP3 player with the same adequate results.Using it a second time in the same day, however, the speaker was silent when I connected it to my computer though the LED lights worked fine. What was the problem? I don\\'t know, but there are two on/off switches, one for Bluetooth devices and another for non-Bluetooth. Did I have the wrong one switched on and the right one turned off? I turned one on then turned it off to turn on the other before turning both on in unison. The LED light worked okay, but there was still no sound. Connecting it to my MP3 player again, I heard sound but now the light didn\\'t work. I played around with the device, making sure it was connected, etc, but nothing changed.A day later, I tried it again. I got sound on both the computer and MP3 Player when the Bluetooth switch was turned on, but the LED lights lit up only on the former. Maybe the device doesn\\'t have the power to fully support those lights. I don\\'t know. I don\\'t care either. I don\\'t need lights on a speaker. Since then, the sound has been consistent on both devices, but the lights work only when connected to the computer. There are instructions (\"Open the Bluetooth function on your device and search the speaker named `V29\\'\") that I did not have to bother with, but which might be necessary if using another device.I received this product free through the Amazon Vine program. I must admit that I would not have purchased it since I am content to listen to music with my Vox earphones on my computer or MP3 player. Nonetheless, I\\'m giving Vibe\\'s Bluetooth LED Color Changing Portable Speaker a passing grade. If you want a portable speaker for a Bluetooth device and are not an audiophile who demands the most sophisticated sound, it is a good deal for the price.Brian W. Fairbanks']\n",
            " [\"Personally, I do like this speaker. Using it has some pros and some cons. What I do like about this speaker is: The color changing aspect, while not necessary, is cool. You can't see the changing in the daytime, but at night it's pretty cool. This Vibe LED Bluetooth speaker pairs up quick and easy with my Galaxy so I can listen to Sirius Radio-it's super simple to use and charge-tho the plugs are not the tightest and can fall out.I like to listen to Old Time Radio on Sirius radio so the sound for this purpose is perfect. I have a couple of small portable speakers that are Bluetooth and sound much better and clearer than this speaker so if you like a quality speaker for tunes, this isn't the greatest. For portability, I personally would bring along a speaker that would fit easily into a backpack or purse - this speaker is fairly large and great for a bedside table-I wouldn't trust to lug this around with the canvas speaker and plastic lighted top-tho it does seem to be pretty sturdy. You could put it out if you have a pool or take it anywhere but it's sizeable though.For my night table and Sirius radio, this works great and I do like it. In comparison to some smaller speakers I own, the sound doesn't equal and is less in quality than my other little Bluetooth speakers.I'd say for a kid's room, this would be great but wouldn't hold up to a lot of shenanigans and would be best stationery on a bedside table or desk where you can enjoy the color changing light. The sound is decent but there are others out there if you are really looking for killer sound from a portable speaker. This hooks to Bluetooth with ease and works well paired with my Galaxy phone and it has a pretty long lasting battery.** I am not sure why, but this speaker has stopped working as it was in the beginning. It's not holding charge and no longer pairing well with my phone. In order to use it anymore, I have to fiddle with it and coax it to work. I am not sure what happened to it. I didn't drop it and don't heavily use it.\"]\n",

The whole thing just feels really cheap.- The top (light cover) keeps popping off.- There is a weird cloth webbing around the speaker.- The AUX-IN plug doesn't work at all.  I tried different devices, nothing on any of them.- The sound was really static-y and didn't sound 'full' at all.- You cannot use it at all until it is completely charged.- Always changing colors.  There is no option to stop on a color of your choice.- The light on-switch doesn't feel like it does anything.  The light just starts up eventually.- For being a portable speaker, the actual unit is kinda big.  It's maybe 10&#34; tall and half of that is the light fixture.  The actual light is a very small LED flush mounted to the top of the actual speaker, so you just end up with this big 5&#34; tall shell (that constantly breaks off anyway).  Poor design all around.The light is OK, maybe to use in a child's room at night or in a dorm room.  I assumed this was a $20 item, but with an original MSRP of $79, and even a discounted price of $25, it feels like $20 too much.  Even at $5 this would make for a better holiday-party-gift-exchange item than something you would actually use in your home from day-to-day.  There is no reason to purchase this speaker at all with better products out there.\"]\n",

There is no high end to speak of, the midrange is flat and the bass lacks definition.  You can identify the song and it doesn't have static, but you get better sound quality from the free speakers included with the Dell desktop you bought fifteen years ago.It comes with an ac adapter that has a USB plug power cord.  The other end of the power cord is a round power nipple that does not stay in the speaker.  It falls out.  All the time.  The speaker holds a charge for about six hours of playback.In the middle of the night, it started emitting a loud noise - very similar to a telephone busy signal.

            " [\"Make no mistake, the Vibe LED Color Changing Portable Wireless Speaker is the epitome of cheap, throwaway products manufactured more for a price-point than for any other reason (e.g. sound quality). The list price ($79.95) of this device is laughable  and no one in their right mind would spend that amount on this portable speaker after spending just one song's worth of time using it.This device does everything it claims to do - it easily synced with my Galaxy S4 and started pumping out music in my kitchen within moments of unboxing. The LEDs under the white dome do in fact gently change colors as your music plays along. There's even an included auxiliary cable included in the package along with a power cord. That's it for the good.The bad... well lets see...First I suppose I should mention that all of your wonderful songs will sound terrible. Flat with no range, no bass, no treble. Even after tinkering with the equalizer setting on my phone (Rocket Player app) I couldn't get music through the device to sound any less terrible. I would compare the audio quality to listening to music coming from my phones tiny little built-in speaker only piped through a series of cones. Like using a paper towel cone to talk through is the best example I can use.Construction quality and materials are below grade. The main body (the black part) has a sort of cloth outer coating that feels ready to fall or rip apart any moment. The plastics are cheap and would shatter at the smallest drop. For a device that has a built-in battery I cannot believe how light the entire speaker is (hello speaker = some sort of magnet). But this speaker feels like a light breeze would blow it tumbling down the street.The device is ugly and much larger than it needs to be. I suppose that's to accommodate the lighting gimmick, er... I mean light show.So why two-stars? Well it does play music and that's, like, the entire purpose of this thing. So if you happen to be looking for a cheap, portable music player for the patio for a season, for a child's room, or as a gift to someone you don't particularly like then this might fit the bill.\"]\n",

In all honesty, it sounds pretty good. But the feature we both like the most about the Vibe LED Bluetooth Speaker, it&#8217;s the big simple touch on/off button in front of it. It has two other on/off switches in the back, one for the speaker, and another for the lights. Which is very convenient to have dedicated switches, because at night, my child can easily turn it on as a nightlight when she has to go to the bathroom and turn it off when she&#8217;s back in bed. We tried different nightlights, and so far, this one is the one she remembers how to turn on while being half sleep.Which is no surprise, since the bottom in the front has a sensor, that only requires a brief tap in order to function. A neat little gadget. Speaking of which, it doesn't weight that much, but I wouldn't classify it as portable either.

With a brand new set of batteries, the lamp outputs 70 lumens.I wanted to see how long three batteries would last, so I turned on the lamp continuously (you would never use the lamp this way) a brand new set of AAA alkaline batteries lasted over three full days of continuous light. That probably translates into a good solid month or two as a motion sensing night-light.The lamp mounts easily to a wall with a small plastic bracket and double sided tape, or you can put two screws in the wall into a keyhole slot on the back of the lamp. The lamp weighs almost nothing and is about the size of a hockey puck. The bottom white plastic edge on two sides has the LEDs in them. The lamp can be switched from off to on continuously or automatic. In auto, the lamp will only come on when the room is dark and it senses motion from about 6 to 10 feet away. It is perfect for lighting a hallway or covered entryway into a house (the unit is not waterproof or water resistant so you wouldn't put it in an unprotected area outside).The lamp is small enough that the design doesn't really matter too much.

The square device has 4 LED lights, one aimed at each side of the little box device and the amount of light is quite amazing. The device has a convenient motion and light sensing function, meaning it turns on automatically in a dark environment when motion is detected and stays on as long as it detects motion, The light automatically shuts off 30 seconds after no motion is detected or if the environment becomes lighted. It can also be switched to `ON\\' mode so that the lamp is always on, and there is no auto-sensing. Just slide the switch to \"AUTO\" to activate the sensor capability.Usually these devices look clunky and distract from the beauty of your home.

In fact, it's perfect for camping or even mounting discreetly in enclosed porches and doorways (as long as it is protected from the elements.)At about three inches square this is relatively small, but it provides enough light in a ten by six foot closet to select clothes by color in an otherwise dark space. I love the auto-on feature because it saves batteries. When it's set the motion detector is disabled when other lights are on, so this does not turn on and waste batteries. Of course you can also manually turn this on, or if you are on vacation manually turn it off so it never lights up.The instructions claim three months of use between battery replacement. I have not had mine long enough to validate that claim, but I have other Ivation products and every one has lived up to their specifications and claims. If I discover that this one deviates I will update my review.\"]\n",

            " ['It seems like half the outlets in our house are taken up by some sort of USB charger, and anything that helps get rid of them is good news.=== The Good Stuff ===* First things first- it works. It had enough power to charge my iPad and iPhone simultaneously, and charging times seemed to be about what I expect from the Apple supplied chargers.* If you can change an outlet, you can install this. There are side-terminals (no plug-in terminals) on the unit. There is only one set of screws, so you can\\'t have the top and bottom outlets controlled differently.* The unit seems to play nicely with the GFI protecting the circuit where it is installed.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* The unit is about the size of the biggest GFI\\'s. The rear of the outlet is roughly 1 3/4\" x 2 3/4\", and it extends 1 1/4\" from the front of the wall. Depending on the box fill and the size of the box, fitting this outlet in may be problematic. The first place i wanted to mount it was a standard box with two sets of wires coming into the box, and a short pigtail inside the box. I probably could have got in all in, but just moved to the next outlet, which was at the end of the circuit and only had one set of wires. No problem installing it there.* The faceplate is a bit of a problem. Both outlets have the ground prong at the bottom. This works OK for the lower outlet, but if you have a larger-sized three-pronged plug inserted into the upper outlet,  it blocks the USB plugs. Would have been so much nicer if the plugs were mirror-images, meaning both ground prongs are facing away from the USB plugs.=== Summary ===The unit is installed and works great. It banishes a USB transformer to the electronics drawer, and makes things look neater. You have to be a little careful about where you install it because of its size, but such is life. I will probably add more of these to the house as time permits.']\n",

With a really mad spouse.Now everything lives in perfect harmony in the kitchen. The toaster is always plugged in. The iPhone is always charge. The iPad is always charge. And a free outlet to plug in a blender or whatever other kitchen appliance you need the time.Every kitchen counter peninsula or island should have one of these installed.\"]\n",
            " [\"With USB charging becoming so popular these days, the fact that we have to carry around a charging adapter seems rather silly. Well, this receptacle changes all that. You can plug in two standard electrical appliances, while charging two USB devices directly from the outlet. It's really quite handy. Installation is basically the same as any other receptacle. This one takes up a bit of space in the electrical box because of the extra circuitry, kind of like a GFCI outlet does. It fits fine, just requires a bit more care to install than a regular outlet.\"]\n",
            " [\"My house was built in the late 1960's and I wasn't able to find a power socket with enough room to use this receptacle as a replacement; the added bulk of the transformer was just too much to fit both it and the wires in the the utility boxes embedded in my walls. So, I ended up adding a new receptacle next to a desk in my basement, where I happened to have access to the unfinished opposite wall inside a closet. As I am not a professional electrician, this took a couple hours of splitting off a pre-existing line, putting connections safely inside utility boxes, cutting a hole in my wall with a jigsaw, and basically using my entire bag of homeowner tricks. I purchased a color matching faceplate at Lowes and it ended up looking quite nice and that desk really did need a more convenient outlet.Another problem is in the case where you need a ground fault circuit interrupter, and there does not appear to be a GFI outlet that also includes a USB charger; you can imagine it would be difficult to include both given the space constraints.You are limited as to what plug shapes will fit on this outlet while using the USB ports. I own a Belkin power strip with a large round rotating plug which blocked both USB ports. In such cases, I like to use ashort extension cord.I've charged an iPad 3 and an original iPad Mini simultaneously so it delivers plenty of current. Also charged an iPhone 5S and a Kindle Fire HD, so it's good at informing devices of the available current.You might want to double check your wiring job with something like aReceptacle Circuit Tester.Anyway, I just think the constraints of this device outweigh the convenience of having ready USB charging ports. In most cases, a regular (possibly GFI) power outlet with a separate USB charger will be preferable.\"]\n",

It provides 3.2 Amps for charging a USB device, which is sufficient for most electronics. I tested it with a variety of devices, including my iPad, and it charged fine.Installation was simple. It does fill up the outlet box installed in my mid-50's house, but it does fit. The instructions for the uninitiated are clear enough, but anyone who has ever changed out an outlet should have no problem. It is one of those little things that you install and forget about, since it simply works. The question remains, where to put it? I have one in my study, and will be buying a second one for my bedside. It's that handy.\"]\n",

Simply turn off the breaker to your current outlet, use a screwdriver to remove it, Then attach the power and ground wires to this outlet, put back in the junction box and screw it back in. Turn the breaker back on. Easy as that.I have seen many of these that say you need a very deep junction box, and that may be the case. In my scenario I didn't have to change the box out at all. I used the standard box that was already in the wall and I had plenty of room to mount this outlet. I used to have 2 AC to USB power adapters connected to charge cellphones, it's great having this outlet as now I can still have 2 items plugged in, but now I have dedicated usb charging ports as well, it makes the plug look so much cleaner and is more functional.I've had it installed now for over a week, no issues at all and it works very well.

            " [\"In an increasingly gadget-driven house, I find myself using 3-5 items a day that require USB charging. Something like this outlet would seem to be a no-brainer for me, but as I installed and used it issues I hadn't considered cropped up.Let me get this out of the way first: if you are in an older home that was initially wired with the old two-prong plug outlets, this probably will not fit in your existing junction box. The receptacle on its own is a tight fit; add in the wires (especially the older, thick-wrapped wires) and it's not going to fit. You won't run into this problem with modern junction boxes (if your box is plastic you are probably okay).This also doesn't come with a faceplate, but will fit in the standard rocker/GFCI faceplate.My main gripe with the Leviton is that there are only three screws to attach wires (one for ground, one for the incoming and outgoing white wires, and one for the incoming and outgoing hot wire) instead of five (one for each wire). Unless the outlet is the end of the line, that means you have to feed the incoming and outgoing wires in straight and trust the clamp, rather than being able to twist the wire around the screw for added security.Once you have it hooked up, it works like a charm - it was easily able to handle two high-draw USB items while the two normal outlets were in use. Just keep in mind that you'll either want to place this where it is easily accessible, like on a counter, or you'll have to run a USB cable to the spot where you will use it and secure the cable there. If that's the case you may want to consider a USB hub or something similar instead.\"]\n",
            " [\"OLD HOME ALERT: My home was built in the 30s and this receptacle was too large for a few of my outlet boxes, so be aware that if your boxes are particularly tight, this receptacle won't fit. I was able to find a few places in my home where it did fit, however, so it seems to do ok in the standard boxes.Installation is straight forward - as simple as installing any standard receptacle, so if you have done that you will have no problem with this. The two USB ports are powered by what Leviton calls &#34;smart chip&#34; technology, which automatically adjusts to your device so you don't fry your smaller devices. I have charged a kindle, iPad and iPhone with no problem and super quickly.With this receptacle it is the little things that make the difference. The vertical orientation of the ports is much easier (for me, at least) to use than the vertical orientation that other USB receptacles use. I also love the sleek, clean look of the face, though keep in mind that you need the big rectangle plate rather than the two hole receptacle plate. I like my receptacles to match, so if that bothers you, heads up. I personally prefer the look of the single rectangle opening.I only wish I had more of these throughout my home - it is my top pick for a USB receptacle - Leviton got it right.\"]\n",

It saves space and makes charging up a breeze.The USB ports are vertically oriented, which is great, because you can still fit relatively large plugs on the outlet.  So you could easily plug up two USB devices and two other items with ease.  I've seen outlets that have horizontal USB ports and they don't appear to be as useful.Installation was a snap and is simple for anybody that has ever replaced a receptacle.  Using it is just as easy.  I just put this receptacle near a table that I often keep my phone and other devices.  It looks much better than having multiple chargers laying around.  I'd seriously consider installing another in my office or bedroom.\"]\n",

Installation was standard, though it only has two screws, limiting wiring options when the outlet is not the last one in a circuit.  Namely, no bending the wire around the screw for a sturdier connection.  The bulkiness of the outlet concerned me, but it fit fine in my ancient outlet box.  It probably would not work with the slim boxes made for tight spaces.The 3.6A capacity means that I can charge my tablet quickly compared to phone chargers.  I also like that I can still plug things in where I have it (kitchen) while I charge my devices without using a bulky adapter.Overall, an elegant solution to the clutter that comes from USB devices.']\n",

That left me with one USB and one free electrical outlet (no better than if I had a charger in a conventional receptacle).Now Leviton did it right.  First off you get two power outlets, so there is no compromise.  You also get two smart outlets, which deliver the maximum power to the attached USB devices.  Basically all you could ask for.  It's not cheap, and you still need a wall plate, but it's a nice clean solution.

It detects motion and body heat within about 3 to 5 feet. The 10 bright white LED bulbs will stay lit as long as you keep moving and for about 15 seconds after you stop. The light is pretty much a pure white, not warm and not that cool bluish color of some LEDs.

The OxyLED uses both a light sensor and a passive infrared sensor. When both of those are triggered (i.e. when it's dark + you walk into the room), the 10 LEDs light up, and where once you were blind you now are able to see, very well in fact!I was pleasantly surprised to see just how well the LEDs light up my closet. The light stays on for about 15 seconds after it finishes detecting motion.Also, and not obvious at first - the adhesive strip you stick to your wall is actually connected to the light via a magnetic strip. So, if you need to mount the light in a corner which covers the battery cover, that's not an issue. Just pull on the light and it will detach from its magnet without making any mess.

From my experience with the Black & Decker blower, the orange release button can become hard to depress. I've assumed from the blower that it may be from dirt and dust somehow entering the bottom of the battery pack from the holes underneath the release button. This battery has similar holes in its housing and I would not be surprised if over time this release button becomes harder to depress and release.It is a shame and I must say disappointing that the batteries are not interchangeable or chargeable in a Black & Decker universal port.  I understand why the EU requires interchangeable universal chargers that more safely control for voltage and keep you from culturing up space with multiple chargers for the same purpose. I wish Black & Decker had engineered  its line better and its storage box. If you are not going to include a case, design your box with more care: include a handle, design compartments to hold all parts and most importantly, design the box to stay closed. Your customers will appreciate it.The drill itself is easy to use. I grabbed a handful of screws of different lengths and put it to the test in an old 2x4. Depress the trigger and the autosense stops screws flush REGARDLESS of screw length. Hold the trigger longer and you drill deeper at a controlled pace with short rotations. I find that holding the back of the drill with pressure keeps screws from skipping and gives me more control. I like that I can use this to drill both in wood and metal. A push button switch like with all electric drills I've used allows forward and reverse motion. The drill is comfortable in your hand and rotates easily. My wife says she believes its design is for woman's hand because of the smaller pistol grip and lightweight features. We both like the small but effective LED light at the bottom that illuminates the point of work. I also like the indicator lights that 1. blue lights a picture of either a screw or drill at the top of the drill depending on mode in use and 2. Indicate the amount of battery charge.The drill driver comes with a 2 yr home use warranty.This is a nice Lithium Drill/Driver for almost all home use needs. At $140 at the time of this review, its price point is competitive with several professional brand models. A quick search on Amazon for cordless electric drills results in a price range from $190-30.  There may be a better 18-20 volt drill to suit your needs at this price. I suspect a discount in time.However, I am happy and I do recommend it with the stated reservations. The Black & Decker is so much more lightweight and easy to maneuver than my older electric Bosh and battery Black & Decker drills. It will be my go to especially for jobs where I will need to hold the drill in place for longer periods of time or in awkward positions like under the house crawl space or in the attic rafters. I suspect this will be my wife's go to as well, that is, if she doesn't hand it off to our daughter because it is so easy to use. Maybe I should just hide it?\"]\n",

            " [\"This Black & Decker drill / driver is very nice and I liked the autosense technology that stops when a screw is flush with the surface.  I tested this B&D; drill driver on a number of 1 5/8 inch screws for a wood fence and it drove them in quite well and stopped when they were flush.  I used the phillips bit attached to the bottom of the drill and I didn't have any problems with the bit jumping off the screw heads.  I used the flat bit on some larger wood screws where I had drilled a small hole and the B&D; drilled them in flush also.  The flat bit jumped off the screw head sometimes, which may mean that I should have used a larger bit.  Switching the B&D; over to the drill mode, I drilled some 13/32 inch holes in 2x4's and it performed quite well.  That was the largest drill bit that I could get into the 3/8's inch chuck.  The drill is a 0 to 800 rpm variable speed.The only issue that I had with this B&D; drill & driver is that the forward / reverse switch is right above the trigger, and sometimes when I gripped the drill with work gloves on, my finger would bump the switch into the center (off) or into reverse.It's nice that the 20V lithium battery is also usable in my Black & Decker weedeater, the LST420.  (However the 20V battery for this drill is 1.5 amp hours and the 20V batteries for the weedeater are 2 amp hours.)\"]\n",

The 20V class has a good amount of power and length of battery life, and the batteries are easy to find and aren't too terribly expensive. This incarnation is black instead of white, but it's still the same fittings and all as the white ones, and the white batteries still fit.The drill does a nice job, and the headlight is a big help. Even with the changeable battery, it's remarkably small and compact and fits into relatively small spaces. Personally, I'm completely sold on the 20V family in any size, shape, type, tool, or configuration, and I think I have at least 1 of all of them; if I don't have it, it's because I don't know about it!

            " ['This is promoted as Black & Decker&#8217;s most compact cordless drill/driver yet, and it is compact and sturdy.  I was surprised by the solidness of it.  It immediately gives you confidence in its effectiveness and longevity.  The two year limited warranty and a 30-day money back guarantee also give confidence in Black & Decker&#8217;s quality in this tool.Some of the initial pros are the battery indicator along with the lithium ion battery that should not be vulnerable to being charged to death and rendering the tool useless, as happened with my prior driver.  Plus, I am glad to know when I pick it up how long I&#8217;ve got with it.  Those two frustrations had inspired me to buy an electrically-powered drill, but I hope I can avoid those issues now.I&#8217;m not going to pretend that I am a handyman which means the simplest tasks can become frustrating which is why I need a reliable and easy to use drill/driver.  For the basic tasks, this has performed satisfactorily and fills the need well.The trigger and reverse button makes it easy to manage the force and direction of the rotation.  The speed adjusts as you put more pressure on the trigger.  It is a fast and powerful drill for a cordless. The grip is comfortable and rubbery rather than plastic.  You can get a good grip on it.  The lights are a nice touch, too.  It comes with one changeable piece with phillips or flathead on opposite sides.  It has a place to hold this piece.  It does not come with drill pieces.  It also does not come with a case.The autosense feature seems to be hit or miss.  The drill does stop quicker than it would without that feature, but I don&#8217;t think this is so much of a reason to buy this over another drill.  The reliability is the selling point for me.']\n",
            " ['First off this is a really nice drill.  It is easy to hold and has great grip and feel in the hand.  The drill uses the same 20v battery that my other Black and Decker tools use, so I can use this battery with them and use their batteries with this drill.  The drill seems very basic since it does not have a clutch, but it is really easy to use.  You use the reverse/forward setting like normal, and on the top you can choose screw or drill.  The drill gives it full power to drill into what ever you are using and when you start using a screw you just press screw and it will automatically switch and it will sense how much pressure to turn the screw and this helps avoid stripping the screw.  If you do have a screw go in wrong and you want to force it on in, you can keep hitting it with the screw setting and it will gently force it in.  The drill has a nice light to help you see what you are doing, and it has an easy to read LCD display that shows how much battery life you have (I have never had a B&D; drill run out of juice on any of my projects, they have great battery life!).In the end this is a great drill!  It feels and works really well and the Lithium battery makes it light and easy to hold when working above your head.  The autosense works great and I have not had an issue.  This is a great drill for general around the house, but if you are used to a clutch you might rather get a regular one, since you probably will notice some difference in power when it senses it (in general, it works great and I have not had an instance that it did not drill in properly).  This is a great drill and highly recommend it!!! Plus since it uses the same 20v battery you can use this with your other tools (I have other B&D; drills, a leaf blower and a weed wacker).']\n",

I also tested a Bosch unit that was more expensive and came with a hard case, this comes with no case.  If I just did small jobs around the house a less expensive corded drill would do the job just fine but if you do something bigger like building a deck the cordless convenience is wonderful.  Autosense and LED light worked great.  20V gives good driving power']\n",

It's pretty lightweight, as drills go, and not having to drag a long heavy-duty orange electrical cord all over the place is very nice.I don't have enough experience with drills to be able to give a detail-by-detail summation of everything this drill can do and how it compares to other drills on the market, but what I can say is that this one sure beats the one I had! I love being able to just pick it up and run with it. (Well, not really run, but you know what I mean.)I have heard that the Black and Decker batteries, even the rechargeable ones, don't last long, but I'm not likely to wear this one out anytime soon on drilling holes in planters and buckets, which is what I'll use it for.I like it.\"]\n",

If I remember to plug in the charger and put the least charged battery on the charger the night before a project, I&#8217;m okay, but often I do not think about a project until the day of, and then it becomes a &#8220;battery and charger tango&#8221; between me and wherever my project is located. At last, this Black and Decker drill with lithium ion battery promises to change all that.First of all, the drill actually runs right out of the box. Just attach the battery, pull the trigger, and, rotation! I knew right away I was going to like it. I removed the battery and put it on the charger. It was fully charged in about an hour (it might have been quicker; I wasn't paying that close attention to it.) The feel of the drill is compact and solid, but because of its small size, it feels &#8211; and is &#8211; much easier to control compared to other power drills I have owned. The power is good, and the LED display, charger monitor, and light are all nice touches. The drill comes only with one two-ended driver bit, but all my old Ryobi drive bits and adapters fit, so I should be able to do plenty of hole opening and screw driving with this with no problem. Operation is smooth. I tested the auto sense feature and it seemed to work quite well. My previous drill just basically lost torque when a screw reached a certain point, so this new feature is definitely one of the highlights for me. And speaking of lights, my 50-year old eyes really appreciate the drive light.Although my use of this drill has been somewhat limited so far, it has tackled every job I've thrown at it will no difficulty or issues. I've only charged the battery once and it is still going strong. I&#8217;m very happy with this tool.\"]\n",

At 7\" back to front (plus whatever bit I need) this is going to fit many more spots.This drill has no clutch selections, but I was able to drill into typical boards with various drillbits with no problems.  I tested a couple of smaller bits on hardwood scraps and was satisfied with the performance.  Driving screws was easy.  The drill stopped at the appropriate depth, leaving roundhead screws sitting at the wood surface and flathead screws with the top of the head at the wood surface.  I was able to countersink slightly by pressing the trigger again.The original price ($140) was, I felt, too expensive for a casual homeowner repair tool, but I noticed the price has dropped, making this a terrific tool to keep charging right in the house for repairing whatever breaks next.']\n",

So, he went to use it and guess what - LOTS of power is packed in this little package! I could see it on his face - utter shock and surprise!This comes with a built-in bit, two batteries - very light weight and fast recharge. Check out the dimensions and weight on this but don't let it fools you...this compared very favorably to his top of the line Bosch and Hitachi drills.

No surprises, easy to see, easy to change.Powerful performance, super light weight - you can use this all day long without fatigue. Small enough for women but certainly still comfortable for men.

I know from experience that the B&D; brand has never been a serious player in power tools. Things started to change the last few years. The company actually puts out some good tools. Make no mistake, like anyone else they still have their share of lemons too.The Black & Decker BDCDE120 comes packed with a charger, (1) 20 volt lithium battery, (1) double ended bit, and instructions. The manufacturer tags a two year warranty on the drill. The instructions are easy to understand. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the battery arrived fully charged. With the battery on board, this drill weighs in just under four pounds.I like the new trim and logo on this puppy. The illuminated drill/drive push buttons located on the top of drill are sweet features. The mounted illuminated battery juice indicator is another nice touch that I wish all manufacturers would adopt. Both are easy on the eyes. From 0 to 800 rpm this drill is primarily a tool for lite jobs around the house.I gave this drill a real workout last weekend when I was removing a stockade fence. Even though the auto sense technology does worked as advertised I found the drill to be a bit sluggish. When the sun started going down the mounted LED light came in handy. I really like the feel and grip of this drill. Surprisingly to me, I was able to finish the job without draining the battery.Since the fence job I utilized this drill to install new bi-fold doors for the closets. It did okay. Like any tool the key is to know its limitations. Obviously this drill isn't going to win any awards for being a heavy duty work tool. It does a good job on wood projects.

But as an independent female I've always felt a little guilty about this.So I grabbed the box, opened it and put the drill together, that was step one and it took less than ten minutes, yay, so easy.Then I grabbed the brackets for the bow and headed to my sons room to mark off where I wanted them.  I had a little bit of trouble holding the drill steady at the height it needed to be, it's kinda heavy and I seriously need to work on my upper body strength, but everything worked out and the pretty soon the bow was hanging from the wall looking awesome.  In fact it is so cool that I think we will put his practice sword up too.I was on a real fix it high and the drill was pretty fun and I wasted time trying to redrill the chair and stabilize the seat.  It didn't work, but I still had fun doing it.I can't compare this drill to other drills since I've never used others, but everything I used it on, walls and wood seats turned out pretty fantastically easy.It was simple to put together.

This drill seems much more forgiving.My only worry with this drill is that as yet, I don't know how durable it's going to be and how long the &#34;auto sense&#34; functions will work.

            " ['Most of the B&D; tools of the past twenty years have been aimed at the homeowner and hobbyist rather than the professional tradesman. They\\'ve aimed at low cost, light weight, and ease of use; these are tools for the occasional household task, not tools designed to be used on a job site. While this drill is indeed aimed at the homeowner, it does have a few features more commonly seen on pro tools, like a 20 volt lithium battery, a built-in LED lamp, and lithium-ion battery. It\\'s also part of a system using interchangeable batteries. including drills, a circular saw, a reciprocating saw, and a number of yard tools. And it has something none of the pro tools that I\\'ve seen have:; A microprocessor controlled torque sensing system that is supposed to automatically drive screw flush.I was skeptical about that flush driving system, so I grabbed a handful of screws and a few scraps of wood and did my own tests, and surprisingly enough, it does work. It stopped immediately as soon as the screw head was flush with the surface of the 2x4 I was driving it into, and it did it three times in a row. What happens, I wonder, If I release the trigger and pull it again? Answer: It starts right up and drives the screw further into the wood.The torque sensing system works well on short screws and consistent wood density. It can get fooled when trying to drive very long screws,  but overall it\\'s impressively consistent. It is useful? I\\'m not so sure. When the drill is in screw driver mode (which you select by pushing on the screw logo on top of the drill)it runs pretty slowly- slowly enough that even a novice shouldn\\'t have trouble with overdriving screws. It\\'s impressive, yes, but not really that necessary for anyone using a drill more than once or twice a year. Iit\\'s really a solution in search of a non-existent problem.In drill mode, it runs much faster, though not nearly as fast as my reference cordless drill, the DeWalt DCD760. It doesn\\'t seem to have nearly as much power as the DeWalt, either, despite the extra two volts. The B&D; would stall out in tests whether the DeWalt sailed through, like drilling with a 1\" auger through a 4x4. All this would be moot if the B&W; was a lot cheaper than a pro quality DeWalt, but it\\'s not; DeWalt\\'s 20v drill, the DC780, is only 45 bucks more, but includes two rechargeable lithium-ion batteries and a 30 minute fast charger, versus the B&D;\\'s one battery and trickle charger. Add a second battery and fast charger, and the B&D; costs even more than the DeWalt.This drill is positioned at a curious price point. It\\'s up there with serious pro tools, but the features are aimed at the novice homeowner who picks up a tool just a few times a year. I think those homeowners would probably be better served with a tool from DeWalt, Rigid,  Makita, or another maker of pro gear. Actually, most homeowners needing only the occasional use of a drill would find themselves well served by one of the many inexpensive corded 3/8\" drills available from these makers. For $40-60 you can get a drill with more torque than most cordless drills, and that will never run out of batteries.']\n",

            " [\"I got this for home use and so far it's really a nifty little beast.  I'm remodeling a garage and I have to use it with lots of screws everyday and it works like a champ.  Battery life is good and recharging doesn't take that long.  It has the power you need at 20 volts and the auto sensor function actually puts them screws in flat just about every time so it's not just a useless gimmick.  As I pointed out in the header you do lose high rpm function in the screw mode, and I know a lot of power users want that high rpm and expect it with a 20 volt drill.  No prob in drill mode it's there.  The auto sensor may not up the rpms on screws but it does get them in the hole flush with the wall or whatever.  So if you're like me and can use the advantage of having the tool do it for you then this is for you but if you want that high rpm screw or drill then you'd best buy something else.  I will however say that Black & Decker had designed this one well and while light on the hand it is well constructed and should last a good while.  I'm buying my Son one for his work (he's a cable installer) cause he used it over here last weekend and said that would come in handy in interior installations where they don't want to damage customer's walls or fixtures.

            " [\"I have 3 Black and Decker 20V drills. This is the BDCDE 120C 20V Max Lithium Autosense. The Black and Decker Matrix is the largest of the three and BDCDE is the smallest. The middle sized one came with a four tool cordless kit which included the drill , a reciprocating saw, a circular saw and a very nice flash light. All of these tools have the interchangeable 20V Lithium batteries. They are all very light in weight. The power of all three are roughly equal and also equal to my older Milwaukee and  Porter Cable cordless drills. I have a 40 year old Sears corded drill which is more powerful than any of them. I seldom use it anymore though because of the convenience factor.The key issue on this drill, the autosense technology, is what I am really reviewing. Most of the drills I have had, had a &#34;clutch&#34; which would be set to the desired force before stopping. This was a number system at the front of the drill. It would then just spin when that force was reached and the screw would stop. This was created to make sure that the screw was not driven too far into the wood or in some cases snapped off  the screw head. I have never found this clutch feature to be particularly useful or work very well. This is because wood density is different throughout the board. It stopped when the force was reached regardless of the screw depth. Sometimes the screw would go in too deeply or not go in far enough regardless of the clutch.The same is true with the autosense, but to a lesser extent. If the screw does not go in far enough, just remain holding the trigger, and it will, in slight increments, slowly drive the screw in until you choose to stop. This is the key difference between the clutch and the autosense. This is a very nice feature, if it is not too far from where you want the screw to end. At times when I used it, the screw only went in half way, then stopped, the drill then automatically drove in the screw in slight increments. This goes very slowly, so...by releasing and then pulling the trigger again, the screw could to driven to the desired depth as you would with any drill. I found that if the wood was fairly uniform in density or I used pre-drilled holes for the screws, the autosense worked quite well. If your concerned with the look of the wood project, you would always pre-drill holes anyway.There are two push buttons on the top of the drill, which are lighted, one for drilling and one for driving screws using autosense. It also has a lighted battery sensor, which is very nice, since Lithium batteries don't slowly lose power, they just go from full force to nothing when they run out of power. This lets you know when you're going to run out of power.  There is a light on the front of the drill so you can see what your drilling more easily. I could go either way on rating this product, 4 or 5 stars. It is basically a good drill, as are the other two Black and Decker drills I have. I'm not sure that the autosense works a great deal better than the old clutch, though it certainly is an improvement.\"]\n",

It runs on 3 AAA batteries that are installed by unscrewing the bottom and inserting the batteries into the removable cartridge. The flashlight has a short lanyard that you can wrap around your wrist while you are holding it or it can also be used to hang your flashlight up. The frame is made a strong aluminum. It has three different modes to choose from. Hit the switch once and the front head will illuminate with 7 LED bulbs. I wish the front LED's were brighter. Hit the switch again and the 18 LED work light will illuminate. This work light is pretty bright for the size of the light and it's good for automotive or boat work and comes in handy while camping. It has a third option that you can push and 6 bright red LED bulbs will start to flash. This would be good to put in your back window if you were to break down. If you were to break down on a busy freeway then you could actually use it like a flare. You can set it on the pavement head down and turn the red flashing light on. If you set it far in back of your broken down vehicle then it will give people more notice that you are broken down ahead.It is water resistant but it's not waterproof so don't submerge it in water. If you get stuck out in the rain for a while then it will probably survive. It's length is 9.8 inches long and it weighs 6.1 oz. The diameter of the head is 1.4 inches and the diameter of the body is 1.0 inch.This flashlight isn't the brightest flashlight that I have used but it has many uses and really comes in handy.

In addition, it reaches greater distances and the light is still powerful. (I tested this in a very dark wooded area with many thick trees, brush etc and found it was very easy to safely see up close or in the distance).2) Red Blinking Emergency Light Mode - This is ideal is your car breaks down at night and you need for the tow truck or repair service to easily find your car.This is also great at night to use is you have any type of 911 emergency at your home or car as the EMS or other responders will see this easily and arrive faster to your site.3) Solid White LED Light Mode - When I held this upward, and placed it on a shelf just the right angle, it makes a nice reading light say when the power goes out or in other situations when you need to briefly read something.***This flashlight I have placed in my car because it is the IDEAL flashlight to have on hand if I have car trouble, need some kind of assistance or even walk in a dark area.This item was provided to me free for evaluation an honest and unbiased review.Highly recommend this SUPERB multi purpose flashlight as I was provided with a sample and like it so much, I am recommending it to you as I believe this is the best multi purpose flashlight out there!']\n",

It's not the brightest flashlight out there, but it will more than do the job for 99% of what I'd need a flashlight for.The 18 side firing white LEDs are my favorite part of this flashlight as they really do a pretty good job of lighting up a larger area.  For the times when the power goes out, I can guarantee you that will be the mode I'll be using.The 6 side firing red blinking LEDs are a nice touch as it makes this flashlight a beacon for those needing help.

The air around us always has some moisture in it.  The moisture in the air is condensing (turning from vapor to liquid) when it cools down to the temperature on the outside of the cup.  Warm air can hold more moisture than cold air.From a practical point of view, fancy method of detection is useful for the bathroom fan so it will not automatically turn on just because the weather is hot and humid.  Instead, with this module the bathroom fan will turn on when the conditions are right for condensation to form inside the bathroom.  In other words it's better at detecting a hot shower vs. normal environmental humidity.\"]\n",

This module works ONLY with the Panasonic Whisper Fan line, and while they are high quality as you would expect from the brand &#34;Panasonic&#34; they are not super expensive as some people have said.  If you search for them on Amazon you will see that they range from $100 for the base model Panasonic FV-11VF2 to about $150 for the Panasonic FV-11VH2 Fan/Heat Combo.They do have a pricier model (about $200.00) that ALREADY has this humidity sensor in it which if you do not already have a Whisper Fan and know from the start you want this feature is a better value and a LOT less hassle, it is the &#34;Panasonic FV-11VQC5 WhisperSense 110 CFM Ceiling Mounted Ventilation Fan with Dual Sensor Motion and Humidity Technology&#34;, whew, that is a mouthful!On the WhisperSense 110 CFM Fan, it already has a built-in adjustable delay timer that can be set from 30 sec. to an hour that activates when motion is no longer detected or humidity levels are below preset levels. There are 3 ways the fan can be set.1) Motion on/Motion off2) Motion on/Humidity off3) Humidity on/Humidity offAlong with other adjustable settings.Bottom line is, if you are like me and have a family where no one seems to be able to remember to turn the fan OFF, and it runs for hours (or all day, SUCKING ALL THE A/C out of the house after it has long finished exhausting all the humid air from the last shower at 8 AM) until I get home at 6 PM and turn it off! It would behoove you to get this to upgrade the Panasonic Whisper Fan you already have or bite the bullet and get the already upgraded model that not only has this sensor installed BUT also has the motion sensor w/adjustable timer that won't run any longer than you want it to, thus saving you waaay more $$ than it costs as you won't be paying for your A/C or Heater to run all day because your family doesn't remember to ever turn the exhaust fan OFF!\"]\n",

One thing to note, which I didn't catch in the initial description (my fault, not the product's):  The vent options are 4&#34; or 6&#34; - so if you've got a 3&#34; vent  on your current fan, you're going to need more parts and do some more work.  I'm fairly handy, so I removed the old unit, recognized the difference in vent size, and replaced those parts (vent cap on the roof, vent ducting in the attic) before installing the unit.  The included hardware made things easy, and since it was bigger it just meant cutting a little more drywall.  After installing, I turned it on and noticed a dramatic difference from my previous unit.  It's quiet.  And it works so much better too.  In all, this is a relatively expensive bath fan, but if it continues to work as it does now, and is anything like the other Panasonic bath fan I have, I can say that your money will be well spent.

I figured that out after extensive research for our remodel.- DC motors are quieter, last longer, and are more energy efficient compared to AC motors.  But they\\'re more expensive.- The practical effect of the \"plug n play\" modules is that this feature allows more flexibility in deciding whether you want motion detection and condensation sensing features even after installation (no more \"wish I got the condensation sensing model, let\\'s tear this one out of the ceiling\").- Since the LED lamps have a standard GU24 base, you can replace them with different lamps (for example some people prefer warmer color temps, and new LED technology is coming out every day with better CRI - color rendition index).']\n",

The instructions are fairly terrible.  However, the installation is really standard.  So, if you have a basic understanding of how this stuff is suposed to fit, you will be fine.  I had a slight issue with the wiring, but I think that is because of something in my house, not the fan itself.Operationally, this is very nice.  The fan is quiet enough that it can run without driving you nuts.  You certainly hear it, but I don't hear it outside the bathroom with the door closed.

            " [\"I have installed and enjoyed using thePanasonic FV-08VQ5 80 CFM WhisperCeiling ventilation fanin one of my bathrooms.  The highly effective ventilation fan is so quiet, it's difficult to tell when it is on.  The Panasonic FV-05-11VKL1 WhisperGreen Select ventilation fan/light is probably overkill for my needs, however I know this is a great ventilation fan.The package for the Panasonic FV-05-11VKL1 WhisperGreen Select ventilation fan/light includes two 7w LED lamps, a packet of screws, Flex-Z Fast mounting bracket, cardboard cutout guide and paint cover, guarantee and installation paperwork written in English and Spanish, the vent housing unit, and the lighted grille.  The electrical wire clamp connector, caulk, 4-6&#34; diameter duct, foil tape, and backdraft damper are not included and will need to be purchased separately.The Panasonic FV-05-11VKL1 WhisperGreen Select ventilation fan/light can be customized with plug 'n play function devices including acondensation sensor module,motion sensor module,Nite-Glo night light module, and amulti-speed module.  Customizing your ventilation fan/light can easily be accomplished after installation, and the modules plug into a space covered by the grille.Installation takes some time, but is doable for an experienced DIYer like myself.  I replaced an old ventilation fan and will install this one in it's place.  Older houses here in Texas do not have ducting with a backdraft damper, and I didn't install one either.  When it comes to altering the structure of the roof, I would rather hire a professional than chance leaks from my inexperience.  However, I won't be worried about doing so in the short term as this ventilation fan is a huge improvement over what I currently have.I started by shutting off the power and removing the old ventilation fan, which is fastened into place, by clamping the grille to the free floating fan in the attic.  The hole is much smaller, so I enlarged the hole to the proper size.  Next I installed the Flex-Z Fast mounting bracket to the joists in the attic and add an electrical wire from the existing canned light.  Then I removed the electrical panel on the new fan, connect the electrical wires, push the panel up into the ceiling and fasten it to the mounting bracket.  The vent housing unit is then pushed up into the ceiling, fastened into place, and the electrical is plugged in.  Lastly the LED lightbulbs are inserted into their sockets in grille before plugging in the grille and installing.  Don't forget to remove the tape from the vent flap before turning the power on.  If you forget this step and turn the ventilation fan on, you may get an error and see a flashing red light.  If this happens, fix the problem, turn the power off, and then back on to reset.  Once all connected, the fan can be adjusted from within the bathroom.  The CFM selector can be switched from 50, 80, and 110, plug 'n play components can be added, and lightbulbs can be changed by removing the lighted grill.The installation process was simple enough to complete, however I often found the instructions too brief and confusing as a result.  There were several times where I had to stop and ponder the instruction while taking a close look at the associated image.  While the instructions are complete, they could be more descriptive.Now that the Panasonic FV-05-11VKL1 WhisperGreen Select ventilation fan/light is installed, it works very well.  The fan has a slight delayed start, and quietly gets to work.  The LED lighting is very bright giving the room a commercial rather than residential feel.  Overall, this ventilation fan/light is an amazing and effective replacement.If customization is not important to you, save some money and look at one of the other quiet and efficient Panasonic ventilation fan/lights.  FOr those who can benefit from customization, easily customized and quiet, the Panasonic FV-05-11VKL1 WhisperGreen Select ventilation fan/light is undoubtedly worth your consideration.PROS:Easily customizableExtremely quiet and efficientEasily customizableEnergy Star and California title 24 compliantWarranty covers 6 year DC motor and 3 year partsCONS:Instructions could be more descriptive\"]\n",
            " [\"Dear Panasonic,Please hire someone whose native language is English to proofread your &#34;Installation Instructions&#34;.  I'm still trying to figure out what is meant by &#34;Please fix the screw carefully to avoid screw slip teeth.&#34;  Also, the wiring diagram shows &#34;Two red wires (Connect to a general manual wall switch)&#34; -- it would have been nice to know that the red wires are only for use with some of the &#34;Plug 'N Play&#34; modules, because without the modules, this causes the unit to do nothing at all.  Which I figured out after having completed installation, and then had to go back and change.Now, on to the fan itself.First thing - make sure that your ceiling is no more than 5/8&#34; thick.  My ceiling is a double layer of 1/2&#34; drywall, and thus there was not enough room between the top of the drywall and the metal fan exhaust.  I was able to make a work around for that.  If you don't have that problem (and most people won't), the installation itself is actually pretty easy, though it is HEAVY.The wiring diagram shows a conduit (really?  most houses just have NM-B 14-2 wire) containing two live (black), two &#34;netural&#34; (sic) (white) and an &#34;Earth ground&#34; wire.  Many people, including me, will just have one black, one white, and one ground on a pigtail from the switch.  No problem for most handy people to figure out, but I think Panasonic could have done a MUCH better job with the instructions and the diagram.Finally assembled, the fan gets turned on.  The LED lights are nice and bright.  The fan does not turn.  I remove the cover, check the connections, and just for the heck of it, give the fan a spin.  It slows, stops, and then starts running in the other direction.  I tried again, several times.  Sometimes it runs, sometimes not.  It has a switch for 50 - 80 - 110 CFM (cubic feet per minute of air flow).  Even on the highest setting, it doesn't seem to move much air - I'm guessing far less than the claimed 110 CFM.  On the other hand, it is very quiet - likely because it isn't doing much.Overall, this thing is only slightly better than a box of junk, and only because the light works.  The light is nice, but it completely fails as a fan.\"]\n",
            " [\"This fan is the cutting edge of residential ventilation technology. It has a high price tag but it delivers is almost all respects. You might not want to DIY the specification, installation and setup, but if you have installed a ventilation fan unit before then you should be well prepared to install this one. You will probably have done some learning up on Air Changes Per Hour, cubic feet per minute calculations and basic home ventilation theory beforehand. With that knowledge and this fan in hand, you should be well on your way to creating a healthier home and bath environment.This unit is built like a tank. It has high quality parts like bearings that are super quite, and a damper that operates very smoothly and seals well again reverse air flows. This is the first fan to my knowledge to have optional modules that increase its functionality and capabilities. The LED lights are a welcomed addition from the older style compact fluorescent bulbs. The speed selector switch makes it adaptable to different sized rooms. There are many things to like.Currently their are 4 modules available to choose from. Only 2 can be installed however. I don't see that as too much of a problem at the moment, however if more modules are released this limit may need to be somehow increased. The 4 modules available at this time are: 1) Time Delay Module, 2) Condensation Module, Motion Module, NiteGlo Module. For me it was easy to make the choice to purchase the Condensation Module and the Motion Module. I needed to install this in a family bathroom where the shower and toilet are in the same room and the fan needed to turn on for both uses. So now it will turn on as soon as motion is detected, but it will also stay on till the humid level is lowered below threshold.Now this is a fan that doesn't really need a switch to operate. It is truly automatic and I think that is a good thing. I used to have a time switch on the fan for the kids bathroom, but that didn't really work well as the humidity levels would be different depending on who took the bath or shower, the temperature of the water used, the time the water was on, etc... It was hard to have a set time that worked for everyone. Now with the humidity sensor that problem is solved.I did not want the Time Delay Module as I do not currently want this fan to stay on all the time to function as a whole house ventilator. I need to install an ERV first to compensate for the air pressure drop in the house that this would create and thus the resulting air infiltration thru leaky windows and doors, or even worse backdrafting down the chimney or other pipes. If at that time that I do install an ERV (energy recovery ventilator) I would probably switch out the Motion Module and install the Time Delay Module. The fan would just stay on the low ventilating speed if using the toilet and only switch to a higher speed if humidity becomes higher.The night light module was not real appealing for my setup, but I imagine some may find it useful. I personally think this feature should be a standard built-in feature and not an optional module. (of course using small LEDs as the night light source)So far so good. This unit has raised the bar on bathroom ventilation fans. I have been waiting for this kind of improvement for many years. Thank You Panasonic for paving the way!5 Stars!!!!!\"]\n",
            " [\"This is my third Panasonic fan.  The first I purchased as a combo heating unit for my upstairs bathroom which is missing another heating source.  The other is an 80cfm regular fan.  Suffice to say, I love these Panasonic fans in the depths of my soul.  Yes, I'm being silly, but the reality is that they are the best.  Each time I did my research and planned ahead, and each time I raved about what awesome products they are.  As before, I urge you to plan ahead and order a Panasonic fan instead of buying junk off the shelf at the big box store.  The extreme quiet alone will make you glad you did.  Nothing makes you feel like you're in a truck stop bathroom or cheap hotel like a loud, rattling fan.Installation is what you'd expect - you need to butt it against at least one joist, or you can add 2x4s as necessary.  It has an extension bracket so you don't need 2x4s on both sides.  This is the full size model for normal construction, but if you're putting this somewhere without much in-ceiling space, you may need to look for a  low-profile model.  The torsion springs on the cover make your installation look professional even if you make the unit a little crooked (up and down; if you don't have an edge parallel with a wall, nothing will save you).This is listed for tub and shower enclosures, where I thought the previous models with lights were not.  It consumes 3.6, 6, and 11 watts respectively at 50, 80, and 110 cfm speeds, which you can select.  (I believe the 110-1130-150cfm unit is the same unit, but geared differently, as they both share the select switch).Here's the deal with the modules as I gathered from the manual (at time of writing, the Amazon webpage was cloudy at best):The condensation and motion sensor modules can work independently or together to turn the fan on and off when it senses one or the other (or either, if you have both modules installed).  However, IF you also have the multi-speed module installed as well, then your fan will run at the lower selected (on the module) speed constantly and kick up to high (the speed you have selected on the actual fan) when one of the other modules (condensation or motion) sets it off.  It'll then run at the higher speed until the timer (as you select it on the multi-speed module) runs out.The nightlight appears to run completely independent of the other modules, and has a ambient brightness selector which you can adjust to your liking.Before, I really couldn't figure out why there was two different speed selectors.  Note that only one is included with (built in to) this model.  The FV-05-11VKSL1 (see the added &#34;S&#34; in that model number?) has that same built-in switch and comes with the multi-speed module.The fan has all the latest and greatest features of the absolute best fans you could buy for your home, and then it has these modules - especially the nightlight and the condensation sensor - that could be really nice additions.  I suspect the multi-speed and motion sensors are more geared toward commercial applications, but could be perfect for certain custom home installs as well.  Definitely recommended.\"]\n",
            " [\"This is a really nice bathroom fan. It is very quiet! We are used to a loud bathroom fan and it will take some getting used to having a fan this quiet. It really moves the air out and clears the room of steam and smells quickly.The instruction manual is geared toward someone with working knowledge of ventilation fans and how to install them.  It is not geared toward a do-it-yourself installation, even though this is easily a do-it-yourself kinda job...the manual just works against that with all the terms and what you have to weed through to figure out the installation steps.  So it might test your patience a little reading through the manual and getting the gist of it, but the installation isn't as complicated as the instructions make it seem.  Without a basic understanding, I think someone would get lost/overwhelmed when reading the instructions.  With a basic understanding , it shouldn't be complicated at all.  I work in Construction and for me it was a simple install.Keep in mind the duct size diameter for this fan must be 4 inch or 6 inch.  Most older homes have 3 inch duct work to the bathroom fans and this will be important to know when you take your old fan out and install the new one because you'd have to change that duct work and where it exits your home (wall or roof)  if you have 3 inch ducting.  For a clearer understanding of this, see the practical guide to installation on the back of the instruction manual.We are remodeling a gutted out house so it wasn't a big deal to replace the old duct work because it needed to be replaced anyway.This is probably the best exhaust fan available and overall we are happy with it.Pros+ Very quiet+ Clears room of steam and smells quickly+ Adjustable Speed+ Lots of optional add-on accessories like night light and motion sensor+ Low energy consumption LED light+ Looks greatCons-Instruction manual too complicated-needs more pictures/illustrationsTip-Be sure to remove the tape inside the round hole that holds the plastic damper in the closed position.  If you forget this step, you'll have to take the fan body back down and remove it because the fan will not blow air out.\"]\n",
            " [\"Understand that while the instructions are horribly written, after a few hours of the install it is the product that you use daily and that should be the bulk of your rating. I do not feel I need to take off a full star for the instructions because most installers will know how to install these without using them anyway. I also do not reduce my rating just because my house might have had something that makes installation harder.Anyone who tells you that there isn't a difference in bathroom fans has never seen/used a decent one. It is like the difference between solid and hollow core doors--you will feel/experience it everyday so why skimp of it? When you flip the switch (or use one of Panasonic's fancy modules like the condensation sensor module I installed in mine) you will look up to make sure the thing is working or if you have it on high, you will FEEL it working from where you are.This fan is solidly built which is apparent both when you hold it and when you see it in action. Having the module options is super cool--in my case my condensation sensor module means I never have to worry about mold or mildew again as the smart fan will run anytime it needs to remove condensation from creating problems. I love that because it means the fan doesn't need to be turned off after a shower (meaning it runs until I remember to turn it off) so it saves energy. I am not sure why you wouldn't get such a feature so I think Panasonic should build it standard.Speaking of energy savings, I love that Panasonic now includes LED light bulbs which produce a decent amount of light without the heat/energy use of normal bulbs or even CFLs. It is just another way that this unit will help pay for its self over time. Now I do not think it produces enough light to be the only light in a larger bathroom but it produces a decent amount (about 100watts of normal light).I highly suggest you make this fan part of any bathroom upgrade. In my opinion, it is well worth the investment.\"]\n",
            " ['The small bulb would work in several settings, but I do like it best in one of my Tiffany-style lamps.  The bulbs go out to the side rather than straight up.  I don&#8217;t need a lot of light in this lamp and certainly don&#8217;t like the ugly curly looking ones.  The ThorFire is a subtle looking one that gives off a nice soft white light that&#8217;s perfect.  It does show off the multi-colored stained glass panels nicely. Sometimes a soft white is much better than a glaring, bright one and in this case, the ThorFire is perfect.  It keeps the lamp from being garish looking and brings out its elegance.With the advent of The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, otherwise known as the &#8220;Energy Bill,&#8221; I replaced all of my light bulbs with CFLs. The CFLs or Compact Fluorescent Bulbs used 75% less energy and were compliant. The replacement seemed sensible, and indeed it was ... at the time. I got a nice rebate for using the bulbs, but soon regretted the decision on more than one level. The bulbs proved to be fragile and within a year a full quarter of them blew. This created yet another problem that the Environmental Protection Agency is now well aware of.The CFLs do have approximately 4 milligrams of mercury per bulb and need disposal at a hazardous-waste facility. Just how many people make use of the disposal option and how many simply chuck them in the trash?  I&#8217;ve flipped a switch and had three blow out at once. LEDs do meet the standards the Energy Independence and Security Act imposes and meets Part 15 of the FCC rules. There are several other nice things about these bulbs and one is that they are long-lasting.

I also like the longevity factor. The lifespan of LED bulbs is considerably longer than other types. This particular ThorFire claims a 25,000 one, an amazing length of time. The CFLs, which are problematic do cost less, but will only last for 10,000 hours (if you&#8217;re lucky).  Small bulbs such as this one don&#8217;t tend to get accidental hits, but it&#8217;s ultra-study and shatter-resistant. Take note of the dimensions because this is a tall bulb and might not work in those small bed-side lamps.

It's a tiny bulb but fits in a standard base socket so it is good for wall sconses or fixtures or other places that the large globe of a standard bulb doesn't fit.  I put it in a fixture that had a mini-CFL in it, but the ThorFire looks far more attractive.  The globe on it lights evenly and completely - it puts out light in all directions.  The color is a warm white, not a blue light like some LED based bulbs.  And unlike the CFL, no flicker.This is an excellent bulb that is well packaged so it should arrive in 1 piece.

The quality of the light is excellent, with no flickering.  It is a nice warm yellow light that is very flattering at 2700K.The base size is E27, which is the European equivalent of the U.S. standard E26 medium socket and so these bulbs are perfectly compatible in all standard light fixtures.  They also accept input from 85-265 volts and so they can be used anywhere in the world.The cardboard packaging gives complete protection during shipping but is easy to open and completely recyclable.These LEDs are of excellent quality and I very highly recommend them.

            " [\"This bulb is best suited as a mood or night light. It's very warm at 2700 Kelvin, so it will provide a slightly yellow cast to white and green decor, but will wash blues slightly. It is perfect for enhancing reds.  There is just enough light on a small, shaded lamp to use for romantic settings or for lighting up spaces when you have guests.What I love is this consumes a tenth the electricity a 30 Watt bulb does (although technically this bulb is the equivalent of a 26 bulb.) Still, every sent counts because my electric bill soars in the summer, so using lower wattage bulbs like this one without sacrificing good illumination is a big plus for me.To be honest, I have relegated the review sample that I received to the role of night light in my guest bathroom. It's not often used, but I did test it out and the light it does cast is sufficient to also illuminate the hallway from the guest bedroom to the bathroom, It is a soft light as described above, so it's neither harsh, nor too dim. Perfect. Where you use it is up to you, your decor (if you are particular about that) and your imagination and needs. If you are replacing a thirty Watt bulb with this it would pay for itself in less than a year, depending on how much you use it. After that the real savings start accruing. Plus it has a dramatically longer service life than filament or CFL type bulbs, so the total life cycle costs are impressively low.\"]\n",

This is the first flashlight that now even I can't even get back from him.Do not let the low price of this flashlight fool you. I've paid 4 times as much for flashlights like this one and they didn't work half as well. It comes in a hard plastic case that it can be stored in. It's rechargeable but also has the option to power it using batteries. And oh my goodness it is bright.

When narrowed completely it actually goes from a round shape to a bright beam that projects a square light. Also you can cycle through several brightness settings and there's an included strobe function.But the feature that really got my husband wanting to claim this light as his is the included S.O.S strobe feature. The light can actually flash S.O.S in Morse code. His comment was that even his expensive duty light (that costs $$$) didn't have that kind of feature.So after a selection of flashlights in various sizes and styles have been tried out, this is the one he likes the most and takes it with him to work as a secondary flashlight.

I like that the user has five functions from which to choose and can cycle through them by pressing the padded control button on the heel of the flashlight. The light produced is beyond belief, covering a large circular area with equal illumination or a small area by adjusting the front of the flashlight. In the small setting the OxyLED has great reach. This comes in handy when the dogs start barking at an animal in the darkness; I can then easily see if they are barking at a dog, cat, deer, possum, or even a coyote.The flashlight comes in a handy plastic box with foam padding in the inside to protect  the flashlight and components.  I like having the option of using the included rechargeable battery or three AAA batteries. It took a little less than four hours to charge the large rechargeable battery.Bottom line - The OxyLED is an excellent flashlight with sturdy metal case and impressive light output. It's well worth the reasonable cost.I received a sample from the seller.\"]\n",
            " ['The OxyLED Cree 500 Lumen Bright LED Flashlight Torch is a very nice multifunctional flashlight. Yet, it is not designed for all purposes. As a former law enforcement officer I have used many different types of flashlights. And, while this is an excellent light it is not one that I would recommend for law enforcement purposes. But, as a general purpose flashlight around the house, for your vehicle, while camping or backpacking this is an excellent option.Aspects of this light that I like:+ Well-made and durable+ No play in tail-switch which is also very responsive and easy to use+ Has 5 different modes to include strobe and SOS+ Beam is adjustable for wide area to narrow+ Comes with a small lanyard+ Comes with one 18650 rechargeable Li-ion battery but you can also use 3 AAA batteries+ IPX-6 waterproof so you can use it in a heavy rain+ Produces a very white bright lightAspects of this light that I would like to see changed:- The tail-switch color is a neon green. I would prefer it to be black.- I would like to see the bezel have edges so that the light is not capable of rolling- The beam is very easy to adjust which is nice but I would like the ability to \"lock\" the beam in a specific position. If you were to hit the bezel on something it will move the position of the beam. Generally, this will not be an issue for most but this is a feature that would prevent me from using this light in a law enforcement situation.Each of these issues is very minor and in no way is a deal breaker with this light.Overall Assessment:The OxyLED Cree 500 Lumen Bright LED Flashlight is a very nice, bright, and durable general purpose light that has multiple output features and uses multiple power methods. It comes in a nice plastic case. Additionally, you cannot beat the low price of this light. I have spent over $150.00 on flashlights that do not significantly outperform this light.I would definitely recommend this light to others.']\n",
            " ['I&#8217;m glad that I took the opportunity to evaluate the OxyLed MD50 flashlight when it was offered, as with a rated output of 500 lumens, this LED flashlight produces the brightest light, of any of the flashlights I currently own.  The MD 50 features three different light levels, two strobe modes, and an ability to adjust the beamspread through an extremely wide range.This flashlight is made in China, and comes in a rectangular hard plastic case, which besides the MD 50 flashlight, also contains an AAA battery cartridge, a generic rechargeable 18650 3.7 volt 1800 mAh battery,  a plastic adapter sleeve, and a wall charger for the 18650 battery.Measuring just over 5 inches, the body design is similar to many flashlights currently being produced in Asia.  It has a rubber covered switch at the end, and comes with a lanyard attached.  Using a commonly employed design, the beamspread is adjusted by sliding the front section with the lens.  Focused by a convex lens, the range is quite impressive, from a wide open circle, to a tight square shaped beam, that reflects the shape of the LED light source.500 lumens is a heck of a lot of light, particularly from a flashlight this small.  I compared the MD 50 to aCoast HP14, an LED flashlight rated at 336 lumens, and the MD 50 is definitely brighter.  If you don&#8217;t need as much light, the intensity can be adjusted down a couple of levels.The MD 50 can be powered from several sources, either one 18650 battery, three AAA batteries, or two CR123A batteries.  Because of their higher voltage, you get the highest light output with either the 18650 or CR123A batteries.The flashlight I received has a &#8220;golden&#8221; finish, which looks more like light brown to me, with a green colored rubber cover on the power button.  The rim around the lens has a sharpened edge, which is common these days, but I would have prefer a standard rounded edge.  The body components appear to be of aluminum, and are heavy duty.  While not waterproof, the MD 50 should hold up well enough in the elements.Delivering a fantastic amount of light, in a very small package, and at a reasonable price, I highly recommend this flashlight to those looking for a versatile, compact, high intensity light source.  The included rechargeable battery and the multiple power options are other pluses, and this would be great around the home, on the job, or in your vehicle.  About all that is missing in a nylon belt holster, but these are readily available on eBay.']\n",
            " ['The Dremel Ultra-Saw is so simple to use and is absolutely perfect for my needs.  I cut a lot of hardboard (wall panel) for crafts and it was always cumbersome trying to cut it with my circular saw or jigsaw.  This is mostly due to my limited space in the workshop.  (My tabletop is too small and I have often made cuts to my boards while they are in an upright position!)  I even have to cut 4x8 sheets in half at the Home Depot or Lowes to make them easier to deal with once I get them home.  The size of this Dremel makes it so much easier for me to follow my guide that I can actually use it fairly accurately freehand--something that was always difficult for me in the past.The blades are fast and easy to replace and are comparable in price to most any blade.  Only time will tell how well the saw and blades perform after repeated use.  If anything dramatic occurs, I will update my review.  But, for now, everything is great!']\n",

I haven't gotten to the trim part yet, but I did begin working on the base--and what originally tripped me up was working around the current door frames.This made things a snap.  I have a big drill too so I used this after I did my primary cuts in the garage, then I needed some trim work.  No need to go outside or to the garage...Johnny on the spot!I love projects--no need for me to delegate to anyone. I love remodeling and decorating and revamping and building.  When I need it shared, I ask for it, but no need to on this one--this made things simple.For very detailed work like building a doll house, it allows you to get right up close, less danger, and use a small blade for more intricate work.Like what?  I carved out a really think PVC pipe for a party--curved lines one one side, then put it atop a light in the ground after spray painting it, and repeated...so the backyard was filled with sculptural pieces for a benefit.I also used it to cut the metal roof on a chicken coop--it's versatile as all get out for all my projects, and those are never ending!\"]\n",

            " [\"The Dremel Ultra-Saw is a new product from Dremel that only uses Dremel Ultra-saw accessories. It comes with 4 blades, a storage bag, handle and instruction booklet. We are seeing more and more tools come with the soft nylon bags for tools. It's very convenient for carrying since the bag has a flat bottom and handle but the bags are not as convenient for storage as a hard case. The hard cases also provide some protection for your tool so I have a little bit of mixed feelings about the case. We kept the box that the saw came in and actually store the saw in the bag in the box on a shelf. I also have a little trouble getting the saw into the bag and getting the bag zipped. The saw barely fits into the bag.We also have theRockwell RK3440K VersaCut Circular Sawand my husband absolutely loves it. I bought that for him a couple of Christmases ago and he has used it so much more than he thought he would.The Rockwell has a laser indicator that helps to make straight cuts and that is one feature that he was surprised at how much he likes. The Dremel Ultra-saw does not have a laser. The Dremel is also a heavier saw, probably because the Dremel has 7.5 amp motor compared to the Rockwell's 4 amp motor. Amazon has videos of both saws so you can see the difference for yourself. Another major difference is that the Rockwell has a spring loaded blade guard. The Rockwell well also has a shop-vac hose attachment for dust.My husband actually prefers the feel of the Rockwell in his hands. The Dremel is a larger and heavier and he says the handle feels awkward in his hands. The Rockwell has a handle that fits well in your hand. The  Dremel has a straight hard handle and the saw torques in your hand when you turn it on, making it feel like you need two hands to get a good grip on it.These little saws can do what several other tools combined can do and a few that they just do better. Plunge cuts are something that these little saws excel at. Much easier to use and more accurate than a jig saw. Doing wood trim work is also much easier. There's not an easier way to trim around base and door jams than with these handy saws.The Dremel has plenty of power to get the job done. Since it is a corded saw, you wont have to worry about losing power, charging or having to buy replacement batteries. You will need to purchase Dremel blades.While the Dremel is a very nice saw. We still prefer the Rockwell because of some nice features plus the overall feel of it while in use.\"]\n",
            " [\"I'm a homeowner and do-it-yourselfer. I have a few power tools (drill, random orbit sander, saber saw, recip saw), and occasionally need another. This month we refinished a wood floor and trim, and ended up replacing a number of floor boards. The UltraSaw was the perfect tool for cutting all the materials, and the ability to do plunge cuts allowed us to do some things that I don't know how we would have done otherwise. So I'm thrilled we had this saw, and I'm sure I will reach for it again soon.But there were two things that drove me crazy: First, there's a dust port, but no attachment for a bag or a vacuum cleaner. What exactly are you supposed to do with the dust? When refinishing floors, you think a lot about dust, and there was no good answer here. Second, the blades work well, but they wear out fast. This is exactly the same comment I would make about my Dremel Roto-Tool, but tiny blades for the Roto-Tool are cheap. Blades for the Ultra-Saw are not.Watch the videos. This saw excels at all of the tasks shown. But be prepared to go buy new blades every time.\"]\n",
            " [\"The Dremel Ultra-Saw is perfect for crafts, small household projects, and in my case, attempts at custom computer cases.  I really like my Dremel rotary tools, so when I saw it, I didn't hesitate to pick up the Ultra-Saw as well.  While it's a nice tool, there are a few pretty big issues that keep it from getting five stars from me.I'm left-handed, and while the extra handle is attached in the center, the blade and shroud are still on the left side, so I still find myself holding it a little awkwardly.  It's not unusable, but I feel like I have less control over the tool as I would have if I were right-handed.  I understand that there really isn't anything that can be done for this short of Dremel offering a left-handed version of this tool, but I thought that other lefties might like a heads up.The included blades are nice, but the wood cutting blades grind rather than cut, and I'm not looking forward to buying the expensive replacements.  Like my Dremel rotary tools, they also put out a lot of dust, and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to use the dust extraction port.  Also like my Dremel rotary tools, I feel like the blades are often just a tad too short.  I find myself wishing that it could cut another half inch deeper.Despite my complaints, the Ultra-Saw is still a good tool and extremely powerful.  The flaws would be a lot easier to forgive if the tool and it's replacement blades were less expensive though.\"]\n",
            " [\"I had the chance to try this Dremel ultra saw out and let me tell you it is awesome. I do small wood working projects, building picture frames, bird houses, work benches, basic furniture and I have a number of tools including a dewalt portable table saw and a chop saw and I used those all the time and loved it. I got to try this out and I wasn't sure if it would fit into my routine but let me tell you some of the projects I have I need to make quick cuts, this is much more convenient then pulling out the table saw and is actually safer to use for the smaller cuts.I recently used this to build a bird house. I started with the table saw to cut some large boards down. I could have used the table saw to get the boards even smaller into the 6&#34; x 6&#34; pieces but that is a tad dangerous. I used this saw and it made me feel much safer as I could keep my fingers away from the blade easier.I haven't tried the zero cut attachment, just the standard wood blade and I really like this thing. It's made completing small projects much easier and faster. I would recommend you get this.\"]\n",
            " [\"I husband loves this new tool.  It is great for cutting a variety of items.  Light weight so it is easy to use and maneuver into a variety of places.  He also loves the grinding attachment.  Helped to get into some small places where tiles needed to be replaced --  it's weight was also a feature in that he did not become quickly fatigued while holding it (unlike some full size &#34;heavier duty&#34; tools)\"]\n",
            " [\"I bought the Dremel CKDR-02 Ultimate 3-Tool Combo Kit with 15 Accessories and Storage Bag last year ($150 on an Amazon deal around Black Friday) and have gotten way more use out of the pieces than I would have ever dreamed.  This is the &#34;big brother&#34; of the Saw-Max SM20, which came in my set.  Not only is it heavier, but it uses larger blades.  I have had a few instances when the small blade on the Saw-Max necessitated my flipping the item over and sawing though the back.  For one project I needed to cut sheetrock and wall studs.  I started with the Saw-Max to cut the sheetrock and make sure there were no wires in the area, then used the Multi-Max MM20 to cut the stud.  The Saw-Max's maximum depth is 3/4&#34;.  It does have markings on the side that tell you what depth the blade is set for.  The Ultra-Saw does not.  The Ultra-Saw, with the included flush blade, would have allowed me to cut part of the stud, but I still would probably have reached for the Multi-Max to finish it.If you are a professional or a heavy user, you probably would be better off with a standard Skil saw.  For my uses (installation of a wall electric fireplace, replacing wood trim, cutting stone and metal mosaic tile, etc.) the lighter Saw-Max was great.  I do like the bigger blade and more power of the Ultra-Saw, but it is offset by the additional weight.  If I were to buy a Dremel saw right now I would probably buy this over the Saw-Max just because it does have the wider blade.  However, I think the 3-tool combo is the best way to go as it gives the options of using the Multi-Max and Dremel 3000.  Oh, and buy extra blades.  They don't last terribly long and they are much cheaper on Amazon.\"]\n",
            " [\"This is a great saw, considering its small size and price. It is very stable, which you can't always expect given a small saw. The cuts it makes are clean and straight. It's also got plenty of torque, surprising for its size.The only con I really can see is that the limitations on the blade size means you're very limited in terms of what size stock you can cut. It wouldn't replace a full circular saw, but if you just want something around for smaller projects, this is a great choice. It's ideal for small crafts and finishing projects.\"]\n",
            " ['This tool has a lot to offer. Its overall design is sleek and well thought out. It comes with a handle that screws in vertically right in the middle, so that regardless of whether you are left handed or right handed, it is balanced so you get good control with your right hand on the body. That also means that it\\'s easy to see the side with the work.The base is designed as you\\'d expect for a circular saw. It has a lock tab so you can adjust the depth. But the bottom is also spring loaded. That makes it work very well for plunge cuts. If you keep the base unlocked, you can place this down with the blade just above the work piece. Then you can push down to the depth you want and keep going. The limitation is that you need to be working on something where you don\\'t need to set a specific depth after plunging. There is no stop for it. It doesn\\'t seem as if it would have been difficult to add one to the design.The maximum depth is exactly 3/4 inch, not a hair more. When I went to cut a 3/4 inch shelf board, I found some spots where it didn\\'t cut all the way through. I also took a piece of finished molding that\\'s supposed to be 3/4 inch thick, but again, the blade fell a hair short of cutting deep enough. This would be perfect for 1/2 inch plywood, but cutting a 2 by 4 from both sides would be touchy unless things lined up perfectly and if there were no bumps on the wood. Even at that, it would be best to use their guide, but they don\\'t include it so I didn\\'t test it. It wouldn\\'t be difficult for them to make a slightly bigger blade, but the one that comes with it isn\\'t ideal. The \"wood\" blade looks more like a carbide surfaced one than a typical toothed wood blade. That gives it the advantage that it will minimize kick back.There is also a dust port, but the dust port adapter isn\\'t included. It feels as if I\\'m using a tool that should have a bag for catching sawdust, which is directed to go flying out of a hole. I can\\'t even find a part number for the dust port adapter on Dremel\\'s website, aside from as part of a kit with an accessory for a different tool. It\\'s also available at Amazon only as part of a bundle with an unneeded guide for a different product. (Dremel Compact Foot and Dust Port Adapter) I can\\'t see why such a basic part was left out, given its small monetary value and the cost of this tool.There is a slot for an edge guide, and many standard rectangular edge guides would fit in it, but it doesn\\'t have a place for a set screw, so you will need to use their proprietary guide.I found this device very easy to control. In addition to cutting a horizontally placed board with more ease than with a circular saw, it was just as easy to cut through a vertical surface. For example if you want to even the tops of fence boards so they are all the same height, that might be awkward with a circular saw if you aren\\'t used to it. It\\'s easy with this tool.There is also a flush cut blade that sits a fraction above the end of the guard when the tool is face down. It would be impossible for it to be literally at the end or the blade would rub against whatever is supporting it. So if you watch their video that shows this device trimming a slot for a wooden floor, you will understand why they add the extra molding strip at the end. If you use aDremel Oscillating Tool Kityou would be able to make a truly flush cut right above the level of what you are resting on. But this Ultra-Saw will be remarkably faster. If I needed to do that job, I\\'d use this tool. But I\\'d first run a scrap piece of flooring through a planer to adjust the height. This issue isn\\'t really a fault of the tool but part of the nature of the type of tool. As a whole, it\\'s as good as you can get if you want a tool like this that makes flush cuts.The metal wheel looks like a large version of the wheels that come with a traditional Dremel rotary tool. I\\'m not sure how long it will last, but this one is larger and thicker. Again, the depth will be limited, and the wheel is smaller than the wood blade. If not, the amount of surface per revolution would most likely be too high. So it works well for work that\\'s clamped in place but wouldn\\'t work for anything where you need depth and couldn\\'t rotate the work. Then again, a reciprocating saw wouldn\\'t help in that situation either, while this one will work on some jobs such as plunge cutting ducts and sheet metal.I haven\\'t tried the grinding attachment, which should work for thin set mortar, grinding paint off concrete and similar jobs, but I\\'d likely want a vacuum attachment for that.It also comes with a nice cloth tool bag, but it\\'s basic and doesn\\'t have specific pockets for blades or to hold the hex wrench.The bottom line is that this does a lot of things well. It\\'s more robust than something like their Saw Max, and if the wood blade were a hair bigger it would replace my circular saw for many jobs with a limited number of cuts.']\n",
            " [\"I'm an advanced do-it-yourself'er.  I do a lot of work around the house and like to purchase pro or near-pro tools.  The Dremel Ultra-Saw fits in the latter category.  It's suitable for occasional use, but doesn't appear to be built for heavy-duty usage.Two things stand out.  First, I've mostly used the wood cutting blade.  It's wearing out pretty quickly.  I've been using it on a number of projects and the wear is already pretty evident...it's an abrasive blade, not a toothed saw blade. I've cut metal a couple of times...mostly steel.  It's worked as expected, the same as any other rotary cutter.Missing from the kit is a fitting for a dust port. The port's there, but there's nothing to hook to it.  Using a dust bag when cutting metal would be a disaster (and probably the reason it wasn't included), but would be very useful when working with wood.The base is spring loaded, which is perfect for plunge cutting.  Like all other circular saws, it locks in place for fixed depth cuts.  The maximum cutting depth is 3/4&#34;.  It would have been nice if they'd made it 1/8&#34; deeper to allow it to better clear 3/4&#34; lumber...sometimes it leaves a tiny piece at the bottom of the cut.Everything fits nicely into the carrying bag.  It's made out of a heavy-grade material, with braided handles...not like the lightweight nylon bags some of the tool manufacturers are now using.Long story short, if you need a tool like this, the Dremel Ultra-Saw is a good choice.\"]\n",
            " [\"I ordered this to replace a CF bulb that tends to stay on most of the time. I find it to be a very warm color and to produce good light, at about the same weight as a compact fluorescent (CF) bulb.The packaging says that the bulb is for indoor use only, and to make sure that the socket can hold the weight. I'm using this in a socket that has a dimmer, although it does not normally get dimmed. Normally the packaging will say specifically that an LED should (or should not) be dimmed - so I would say this one will work with a dimmer. The CF bulb it replaced was pretty bright, and I really like the warmth of this bulb instead - it is far less obtrusive. Being an LED, it is a bit heavier and longer in the base. I have several LED bulbs in the house, but none has been in use long enough to determine if the longevity claims for LED bulbs are true - they are supposed to last a lot longer than CF.Summary: This bulb works well as a replacement.

I can see a split second delay when I turn the switch on to when the bulb lights, but it lights up all the way, no waiting for it to get bright.If it lasts nearly as long as it promises, it's a great bulb. I didn't give it 5 stars because it is not the kind of bulb you can use everywhere.

This is not a problem for me because in my bathroom fixtures bulbs are pointing down, but this would be a problem if bulbs were pointing up because there would not be enough light coming down.  The solid part of the bulb next to the base of the bulb creates a shadow.Overall, this is a nice light bulb that emits warmer color light then other LED bulbs.

If want want a dimming LED bulb though, you're probably going to have to spend more than what this bulb costs. Like many LED A19 bulbs, the light is semi-directional. Although this doesn't bother me at all, it might not be the best choice for use in a reading lamp, etc. The bulb reaches its full brightness within a split second unlike CFL bulbs. The color temperature of the bulb is 2700k, and puts out 800 Lumens, which is equal to a 60W soft white incandescent bulb. The life expectancy is 25,000 hours and uses only 10 Watts of power. All in all, it's just a good LED bulb.\"]\n",

It is one of the few A series LED bulbs that works well in damp locations, but should not be used where exposed to water/weather. This means if you have a special lamp fixture or lights on a paddle fan that are on your covered porch, these would be good option.&#34;Instant on&#34; means different things to different companies.

For a vastly different technology, like CFL, I am willing to accept some lag time or dimness while warming up (in some applications, not all), but CFL has drawbacks which will prevent mass adoption.  Poor power factor, lots of harmonic distortion (electrical interference), slow to light up, etc.Thankfully, LED technology offers the promise of being both instant on, and full brightness immediately.  Most LED bulbs deliver on this promise.  However, if an LED bulb takes half a second to turn on I don't recommend it.  There are plenty that start instantly, why anyone would want a delayed start one is beyond me.I have 3 different lights in my bathroom fixture, and the other two start instantly.  This bulb takes half a second to start.The two I like better (also from Vine):http://www.amazon.com/GE-Lighting-68017-replacement-800-Lumen/dp/B00AC7RBEOhttp://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Tsusho-4TTO18174-8-5-watt-Light/dp/B00APB0IX8Both start instantly, are similar brightness and color, and the Toyota is even cheaper.So even though this Sylvania bulb works just fine, it fails to meet my expectations of how an LED bulb should work so I don't recommend it when there are so many other LED bulbs which meet my expectations.\"]\n",
            " [\"This is a great 60W incandescent lamp replacement bulb.  It is low power, light is similar to incandescent.  The lamp only emits light from the top half, so it will not illuminate under a lamp as well as a incandescent lamp as most of its light goes up to the celling or to the shade, but I have not noticed this to be a problem (it might be in certain circumstances).Also, do not connect this to a light dimmer - it will not work well, rapidly flashing.The lamp is rated for 25,000 hours, but then, who is counting?  My experience with many brands of LED bulbs at various wattages, light type and bulb shape has left me with only one bulb (not from this manufacturer) that blew out very very early.  They replaced it free of charge.  I have something like 30 LED bulbs in my house so far, so the lifetime expectancy so far has been met.  I don't expect to live long enough to test the 25,000 hours of use... :)The big thing is to choose based on light output, light type (warm white, cool white, daylight) and price.  Most of the LED's come from the same manufacturer anyway.\"]\n",
            " [\"Now that white LED bulbs have dropped in price, it is great to see quality brands like Sylvania producing these at affordable prices. I have a bunch of Lighting Ever 6000K 830 lumen LED bulbs around the house. They do not produce IR or UV radiation, so bugs are not attracted to them at night. CFLs, fluorescent tubes, and incandescents emit IR radiation, so they attract bugs at night!I am not a fan of the 2700K soft white color, but I am impressed with Sylvania's quality. I'd recommend giving their daylight white a try, even though it is rated at 5000K and not 6000K. The daylight white has much better color reproduction, and should help fight Seasonal Affective Disorder for the states that don't get a whole lot of sunlight year-round.I measured the power consumption to be 11W, so there is significant power savings to be gained by switching from incandescent (60W typically) or CFL (20-30W) to these LED bulbs.Overall: 5/5 stars\"]\n",

It does not need to &#34;warm up&#34; but instead provides full intensity of light as soon as it's turned on.  As the box says, it is not dimmable and if you put it in a dimmer fixture (even an electronic dimmer) it will flash like a strobe.  The main disadvantage of this bulb is that the bottom half of the bulb is covered by a white plastic so the light really only shines out of the top, like a flood light.  I think this bulb would work best in applications where it is mounted facing down  or to the side.  I did not see any warnings about shortened bulb life when facing down but that is a possibility.I compare this to the Creed LED lights which Amazon also sells and the Creed come out on top.  For the same price, they are dimmable, have a good color tone, a nice rubberized coating over the bulb that helps prevent breakage, and are also instant-on.  Because the Creed bulbs provide omni-directional light they more closely approximate the old incandescent bulbs that so many of us are replacing.Overall a good, solid bulb for specific applications where directional light is needed and dimming is not required.Hope this helps in your bulb shopping!\"]\n",

They are not a bright white like the Philips (which states it is a bright white bulb and totally delivers on that promise) but have a somewhat yellow appearance by contrast.  They look IDENTICAL in illumination to standard incandescent.  If this LED and the Philips were not side by side I don't know if you would notice that it has a yellower cast.  I think most people would not notice.The Walmart bulb retails for less than half of the  the price of the Sylvania bulb here in the midwest.  So because the light output and color are the same I'd personally go with the cheaper LED....  But I haven't had any of my LED's long enough to tell if they are going to last.  All three brands boast at least 18-22 years..... so if the Walmart one burns out in under 2 years then I guess that will change how I feel about it.To sum up, this is a good bulb and comparable in price to many other LED's I see listed here on Amazon and most in stores...but if you look you can find cheaper alternatives with the same quality.\"]\n",

We have several LED bulbs already, most by Cree, and all of them have some sort of cooling fin design or funny shapes.I was concerned about putting it into a simple table lamp, with the bulb base down, because I didn't think much light would radiate down for reading purposes. But the bulb actually behaves much like an incandescent. There is good light all around. After an hour of use it still was relatively cool. I didn't notice any buzzing or a hum from the bulb. The color of the light is also warm, and it is bright resembling an incandescent 60 watt bulb.We still have a few more fixtures for which we want LED bulbs.

But my favorite thing about this bulb is that I could touch it even after it had been on for hours without risking some sort of serious burn.The only con I can think of is that a little bit more brightness might be desirable, especially for room lighting as opposed to reading/task lighting, but it's pretty close to the incandescent it replaced. Overall, you shouldn't be disappointed for this quality at this price.\"]\n",

You should also note that this bulb is not dimmable.While a table lamp may not be the best use for this particular bulb It would be perfect in a wall or ceiling mounted light fixture.  It also has an advantage over many other LED bulbs that you can use it indoors or outdoors.

            " [\"After buying an older home, one of my little side projects has been to phase out all of the incandescent bulbs throughout the house. I ran into a problem with some of the older lamps, however: CFLs were taller than normal bulbs and either did not fit or stuck out over the lampshade. I then tried some of the early-generation LEDs, but their not-complete coverage area still left me with some lamps I could not switch out.This newest-generation LED bulb, however, fits the bill perfectly. Virtually identical to an incandescent in size, with a spherical lighted area that ensures all-around illumination, and a light output that isn't as harsh as most CFLs. And the energy savings is a great bonus, more than offsetting the additional cost over incandescent. For example, at my current electric rate, the $10 Sylvania LED and a $1 incandescent would have the same cost of ownership after about 260 days, assuming the light is on for 8 hours a day. Every day beyond that is saving money at about 6 cents a day, and this light is expected to last over 8.5 *years* at that rate (never mind the fact that you'll have to probably replace the incandescent way before then).It may be a bit of a sticker-shock up front, but trust me: over the long haul, this light will more than pay for itself.\"]\n",

I have some of each (though I have no dimmer circuits), and don\\'t see any difference in the quality of light emitted from dimmable or nondimmable LEDs.  LEDs are supposed to provide \"directional\" light (while incandescents provide 360-degree light).  My LEDS do project \"light circles\" on ceilings, but it\\'s easier to read under LEDs than CFLs or incandescents, because the LED light is so strong and bright.LEDs generally should not be used in completely enclosed fixtures, or in outdoor fixtures exposed to the weather--be sure to read the packaging information.

It is a soft white light that is similar to an incandescent except that about half of the bulb is covered by a plastic housing which blocks the light on that half of the bulb. In most of the lamps at our house this isn't really a problem because the shades are light and they reflect the bulb. This wouldn't make any difference at all in a ceiling fixture If it was facing downward. The bulb is non-dimmable.We eliminated all of our incandescent bulbs years ago and replace them with CFL's. Now, in the last couple years, we have been converting to LED. They seem to give off a better light, are Instant on, and they last a lot longer. They also run a lot cooler than either incandescents or CFL's. It isn't a big thing in the winter, but in the summer with the air conditioning on, it seemed kind of dysfunctional to have incandescent bulbs, the same things that were used to bake little cakes in those old kid's Easy Bake Ovens. (Am I dating myself that I remember those?) LED's by comparison are mostly light and very little heat. An advantage that they have over CFL's, is that you can turn them on and off several times without affecting the wear of the bulb. It affects the life of the bulb to turn CFL's on and off during short periods of time.This bulb is rated to last 25,000 hours or 22.5 years with three hours per day of use.

These bulbs are perfect for applications where the lightbulb faces down, but are not as good for upward-facing applications.I was pleased with the warmth of the light produced, as it is close to a tungsten-filament bulb and much better than any CFL bulb I have tried.

            " [\"The TaoTronics TT-DL05 LED Desk Lamp has become an excellent lamp to use on our workbench in our garage when we are doing repairs or handling items that we need a bright light on.  Examples of this would be when we clean our handguns after going out on the shooting range. The lamp allows us to see clearly inside the barrels, and make sure all the cleaning solutions are completely wiped off.  It also has come in handy when doing tedious electrical work that we use small tools on.The LED lamp omits a bright white light. It does not have a ghosting or glaring effect around the lamp head, but do not look at the light directly.  It is so bright that you will be felt momentarily blinded.  The touch power and dimming work well.  For dimming and increasing the brightness, you can either slide your finger up and down the touch beveled slide or you can tap it.  The base is well balanced so it will not tip over.I can not feel any heat coming from the lamp head, but the AC wall plug does get a bit warm. The lamp's arm is so flexible that it can be bent frontwards or backwards, any angle and it still stay wherever you place it.Great LED for a variety of uses.  Has a one-limited warranty.Review sample.\"]\n",

Control is easy, just slide to the left of right to increase or decrease brightness with 7 red LED's indicating the brightness setting. Turning on the lamp is just as easy with just a touch of your finger.  The lamp does have a memory feature so it will remember the brightness setting next time it is turned back on.Technical Specifications:LED9w max power5500k-6000k Color TemperatureThis lamp uses a LED bulb which last longer and use less than 75% energy when compared to incandescent light bulbs. If using this lamp for 5 hours per day the bulb will last up to 22 years.The packaging that the lamp comes in is well thought out. The lamp comes in a box with a plastic handle to make it easy for carrying.  Inside the box the lamp is wrapped in bulb wrap and is cushioned with syrofoam molded to the contours of the lamp.  In the box you will find the lamp itself, a 12v/1A DC power adapter, cleaning cloth and instructions.Overall, I am quite pleased with this lamp and believe that TaoTronics has a great product here.  This is an LED lamp that comes in both black and pink and is touch controled.[A Review Sample Was Provided For Evaluation and Review]\"]\n",
            " ['This combines very nice styling that also performs well. I love the overall look - understated overall, but the design aids performance rather than get in the way. The base is large enough for stability but, at about 7.5 inches deep and 5 inches wide, it doesn\\'t take up much desk space. The lamp head is wide enough to support excellent light dispersion but remains thin and fairly unobtrusive.Best of all, while it is black, it is covered in a \"rubbery\" type material with a matte finish that totally hides fingerprints.The controls are touch sensitive, so there\\'s no actual button. To turn it on (or off) you tap on the left most edge of the groove. In the grove there are other touch sensors that change the light level.  It remembers the last brightness setting when turned off.The light output is excellent. It\\'s a cool temperature, which makes it excellent for reading. Zero glare or shadows.Since it\\'s an LED light there is very little heat output and it uses only 9 watts when running. Basically, you\\'re getting much better light quality at a fraction of the energy use of an incandescent, and even less than CF bulbs (which I never cared for due to the poor light quality).The arm is bendy which made it easy for me to position it right where I needed it (next to my monitor) without any glare on the monitor or my eyes. It\\'s easy to bend but stays put when positioned.It comes very well-packed in molded Styrofoam and bubble pack. Made it through the UPS journey with not a scratch or ding.The only minor quibble is that the power supply has a wall wart which blocks a couple of plugs on my powerstrip. An inline transformer would have been much nicer.But regardless of the wall wart, this is one of the nicest desk lamps I\\'ve used. Great looks, excellent performance, and low energy use. Highly recommend.[Sample provided for review]']\n",

            " [\"I received this lamp as a review sample and as soon as I unboxed it and switched it on I fell in love. It's very bright at 450 lumens, which is close to a 40 Watt incandescent bulb. Moreover, the color temperature, which comes in somewhere between 5500 and 6000 Kelvin, is in the range of strong daylight. That makes reading easy for me and this is the perfect reading light.It's tempting to wax enthusiastic about features that others have covered so well, so I will just agree and get on with that I would love to see. Specifically, this light is so good that I would kill to have one with a clamp for a music stand. Well, perhaps not kill, but I would love it just the same. One reason is my vision is not as good as it once was and a good strong light works wonders for reading. The lamp head is one of the best I have used.There are a few other features that I love. At the top of the list is the light is rock steady. It does not flicker, and while it's in the strong daylight range, it's not glaring. Those are especially important to me because I suffer eyestrain easily.Of course the nine Watt power consumption of a fraction of an equivalent incandescent bulb, and I love saving money. Although it comes with a microfiber cloth it doesn't really collect fingerprints like I though it would.Bottom line: if you want a strong reading light that is perfect for both hard copy paper pages as well as computer screens this is perfect. If they do make a clamp on one that I can use on a music stand I will be first in line to purchase it.\"]\n",

Drag your finger right (or tap anywhere in the indent) to increase brightness.It's output rivals my desk halogen light for brightness, and far surpasses it in looks and flexibility.

In the package were the lamp unit, a power cord, and a user manual written in English, German, and French. I like the soft, smooth feel of the lamp itself and even occasionally use the base of the lamp as a mouse pad. Aesthetically the lamp is first rate, and for me its functionality couldn't be better.  I mostly use the lamp when I am using my laptop, one without illuminated keypad. Like Goldilocks (without the hair) I've tried numerous lamps for my particular application; some were too bright or too dim - some too small or some too tall.  The TaoTronics TT-DL05 is absolutely perfect.Minimalist in design, the desk lamp has no buttons or switches, just a touch pad to control on/off function and the brightness of the light.  Somewhere in the range of brightness, a user should be able to find a perfect setting. If you turn the light off for a bit and return later, the lamp will come on at the last setting chosen.  For me the lowest setting is best- enough to clearly light the working area with a high quality even light yet one not too harsh for me or the two parakeets sharing the table with me.This is my second lamp from TaoTronics.  Mrs. Spudman likes the first light so much that she hijacked it and uses it instead of her former favorite, an Ott light.  She won't be getting her hands on my new favorite, the TT-DL05.Looking for the perfect desk lamp with touch pad adjustable settings and a smoothly positionable neck that moves easily up and down or side to side?

Yes, it looks better or more like what we are use to seeing over the Energy Efficient/Energy Smart spiral light bulbs.

If the light looks good and doesn\\'t hang low, my total project cost will be $81 with Prime.OR, if I decide to splurge because I like the look (+1Star), then it makes sense to consider the other half of this advertising coin which you will notice on the Product Page: The Reveal (2850K) at $40 a pop and a total project cost for me of $360.Toggle to the Reveal option and Zoom in on the room comparison on the Reveal box. If I am going to spend over $300 on a project, then I don\\'t want to be disappointed by the soft light which may not give me as true colors --AND-- I don\\'t want to change lights and pay twice. Am I am going to be an unhappy camper to find out that I needed only spend an extra $35 for, to my eyes, a distinctively better look and feel? I think so.I typically have bought both Reveal and Soft White in standard bulbs. I like Reveal better in standard bulbs because it seems as if colors are more saturated. It helps in reading and seeing colors clearly. I like Soft White in the bedrooms and rooms where I want to relax.I don\\'t have the experience with LEDs to make that determination.As I toggle back and forth I notice a couple of other curiosities:  The same reviews appear under both products; yet as a Vine Voice I (and I assume others) received only the Soft White. The Reveal description states that it contains \"no lead or mercury\". The Soft White description makes no such claim.Generally, I like this bulb. I can\\'t attest to performance. It offers superior energy efficiency over standard or halogen bulbs. Click on GE\\'s Light Bulb Buyer\\'s Guide on the Product page. Read down to the CRI chart. GE states LED bulbs do not show color as accurately as ANY other type: Incandescent, Halogen or CFL spiral. So I suspect the choice between the Soft White and the Reveal will make significant differences in color and be very noticeable. Not so good if you have art on your walls which you want to show off or if you have specific color combinations that you have tried to achieve in a room.Do I recommend this?  Yes, with reservations stated. You decide what\\'s important to you and your application.']\n",

            " [\"Bottom Line:  Quick and Relatively Easy to Install.  Provides economical instant 2700 Kelvin yellow lighting.This was much faster to install than I imagined, but it took an equal amount of time to get it to fit flush against my ceiling. Probably like most of the other people, I didn't go trip the circuit breaker in the garage to make it less likely to get electrocuted.  Flipping the switch is quick; knowing which switch to flip is another issue altogether.  And resetting the various clocks afterwards takes time, too. But as an electrical engineer, it is my duty to say it is far safer to trip the breaker anyway. Installation of the LED light is a lot like screwing in a conventional light bulb except you have to be much more careful where you grab - never touch the metal part.  Separate the wiring at the inline connector before attempting installation. Afterwards connect the inline connector after you screw in the socket connector. Realistic installation time is below.I have about 20 recessed lights in my house.  I converted all but four to CFC floodlights three or four years ago and I wish I had converted all of them.  I still like the CFC lights except that it takes a few minutes for them to warm up to full brightness - not a big deal to me. It&#8217;s quick enough. I strongly prefer 5000 Kelvin white light versus the legacy yellow lighting. It has been demonstrated that white light reduces winter depression - simulates sunlight.  I like it because it is the same spectrum as sunlight and it feels brighter to me than yellow light of supposedly the same lumens.However, there are always exceptions.  In my case, I had a white LED floodlight over the kitchen sink and there was really harsh light reflecting off the stainless steel sink. Yellow lighting works best there. So that worked out fine for this GE LED floodlight assembly.  The floodlight design doesn&#8217;t match anything I have in the house.  I only have one floodlight in my kitchen, so that&#8217;s where it went.  I had a lot of difficulty to get it to fit flush against the ceiling &#8211; don&#8217;t know why.  I twisted it while pressing with no luck. Finally I removed it and rotated it and reinserted it a couple of times until I found the magic placement and quit while I was ahead.  Architecturally, I don&#8217;t think it looks as good as my other recessed lighting, but it is adequate.  As another person noted, it would cost a lot of money to replace all the recessed lighting in a given area. Hopefully the price will decline once it is in full production to make it more affordable.  I am in the early stages of planning a custom home and I&#8217;d be hard pressed to use this in an upscale home. I have time to evaluate it and maybe it will grow on me as I acclimate.5 minutes to find my ladder and return it to the garage.5 minutes to remove old light and annulus and find retaining springs on the floor.4 minutes to actually install it.5 minutes to remove it and rotate several times to make it fit flush against the ceiling.4 minutes to clean up the plaster debris off the countertop and floor.\"]\n",

The flat bulb lens and integrated flange sits flush with your ceiling, behind the fixture trim ring, and really does look good whether it is on or off.  It looks and works way better than the compact florescents we attempted to use -these are instant on, have way better quality light, and are dimmable (which most recessed lighting is set up to be).  Installation was a snap -the screw in base is on wire leads, and the light head just slides/clips into position, then you replace the ring. This one is a 65w soft-white replacement, which gives very similar light output and quality to the frosted 65w incandescents that were up there to begin with, and they look like they were made as original equipment for the fixtures -totally unlike the CF replacements that did little more than cast an eery glow out of the pot.

Now, as for why one would want to replace this entire fixture rather than just the bulb is a bit more confusing aside from the visual appeal. This is totally flush and looks better. As for this compared to replacing the entire fixture, no electrician/other is needed and with the built in bulb, the cost is actually considerably less.As for price, this is an all in one piece. I've replaced most of the bulbs in our house with LED that range from a low of $10 each to as high as $40 each. Floodlight type bulbs routinely run $20...even more depending upon wattage, ability to dim etc....so, although the initial cost appears high, it's not that much of a premium.This has a very warm look - a bit more yellow than expected. Very fast install.\"]\n",
            " [\"This GE recessed LED Bulb is designed with the bulb built in to the trim/fixture, with an adapter that screws into the bulb receptacle in the ceiling. The total length of this was longer than the ceiling space holding the original flood light where I was placing it, so it ended up sticking out a tiny bit. You will want to measure the length of the recessed area to see if this will fit properly in your spot without having to remodel anything. Otherwise, this is easy to install, and it would look nice in a white colored ceiling where it would blend in. The light is warm and vibrant, brighter than my old flood light, and it is dimmable (how much depends on the type of dimmer switch you have). Unfortunately, if you have several floodlights and replace just one with this combined light/fixture design it will look odd. Thus, these might be better for a new setup where they would match and you wouldn't be removing an old trim/fixture. If you don't need to replace the fixture then you may just want to buy an LED bulb. Therefore, I have to say this is a nice lighting option but not one that is practical or cost-effective for everyone seeking replacement indoor floodlights.\"]\n",

Pull out the old trim ring (Hah - springs - OK, I could have managed to hurt myself somehow), unscrew the old bulb (CFL - not even hot.)

I wasn't able to remove the trim around my existing recessed lighting, and as a result, I can't use it.  I would have loved being able to put an LED light in there- they stay cooler and last much longer, without the problems that come with fluorescent and incandescent bulbs.I don't feel comfortable dealing with electrical stuff (other than changing a bulb or battery...) and I'm not about to call in an electrician to help install this, so unfortunately, I have no use for it.\"]\n",

This item not only replaces an R30 bulb in a recessed lighting fixture, but also replaces the trim around the bulb. You must remove the bulb and the trim of the fixture you want to use this in, screw in the lighting plug into the fixture's bulb socket, connect the lighting plug's other end to the new LED lighting unit, then press the unit into the recessed fixture. Depending on your style of trim and how far your old bulb was recessed, you may have to adjust the bulb bracket in the cans to fit the new fixture, which is 1 inch taller then a standard R30 bulb.I have used various brands and styles of LEDs in my home and the is by far the strangest. It's a more complicated setup then a regular R30, but it also uses a bit less power then most other R30 LEDs and supposedly lasts 50% longer.Unfortunately, the room where I intended to use this had recessed lighting fixtures that were too shallow for this device. As I mentioned, it's 1-inch taller then a regular bulb. I ended up using it in a hallway fixture, however the light seems to focused... my old trim did a much better job dispersing the light. This 'bulb' claims to have an output of 700-Lumen, however it seemed to be noticeably dimmer then a 630-lumen LED bulb I have.I'm glad I ended up finding a use for this 'bulb' where only one is needed because, frankly, I wouldn't want to buy more... slightly less wattage and a longer lifespan that won't even be noticed (or proven) for two decades isn't enough for me to replace the trims in my lighting fixtures that were purchased specifically for the lighting preference in each room with a 'one-size fits all' generic trim shape that seems to do very little. The marginal benefits aren't worth the added hassle of installation, nor the high price tag.\"]\n",

Once installed, the light has an attractive, simple appearance with a clean-looking modern trim. At only 10-watt, I was very impressed by the amount of incandescent light output. I put mine in the kitchen, but the classic design would be suitable anywhere, living room, bathroom, etc. The box advertises that the bulb will last nearly 32 years, so your next replacement will probably be some futuristic solar vapor light.OVERALL: If you're in the market for a dimmable, flood downlight with attractive white trim - I certainly can't complain about this one! Puts out plenty of light, easy to install, and attractive. Also, if you're nervous about ordering a lightbulb from Amazon, don't worry. It was extremely well-packaged and will easily arrive undamaged.\"]\n",

It can be hooked up to a dimmer (we did not test this).It boasts low energy consumption, and that over time of course can save you money--the lamp can pay for itself.

This GE Lighting LED 6 inch Recessed floodlight is easy to install, looks fantastic, and of course lowers your carbon footprint while reducing your electric bill. If you have one of those full sized floodlights that screw into a can fixture, all you do is remove your old floodlight. Then, screw in the light bulb base that's attached by a 10 inch long wire to the bottom of the LED light. After the light bulb base is screwed in, you push the LED light into the can fixture.  These steal prongs along the side secures the LED into your can fixture.  The edge of the light forms one continual surface with the white metal trim, that sits flush to the edge of your can fixture. Unlike incandescent floodlights, with this LED light in place, you cant look up into the can fixture to see dirt, cobwebs or whatever.  Unlike incandescent floodlights, or even some LED floodlights, this wont overheat inside the light fixture either. It looks stylish and sleek, once its in place.

A good quality brad nailer is one of those things that anyone doing home repairs shouldn't be without. The Bostitch Smart Point Brad Nailer is an excellent buy.Me being a novice, my main concerns were: Is it easy to load and use? Is it lightweight enough? Will it last? All of these concerns were addressed with the Bostitch Smart Point. This brad nailer was extremely easy to load.

The brad nailer is lightweight enough that I can use it with relative ease, and nailing is smooth and effortless. I really appreciate the smaller nose, since I'm still perfecting my skills, and my aim can be off sometimes. But the small, tapered nose shows you exactly where the nail will be going. No guess work. The &#34;dial-a-depth&#34; wheel is also easy to use. I did find that the selectable trigger system (allowing you to select whether you want just one nail to come out at a time, or several in succession for faster nailing) wasn't as easy for me to use as you would think. The belt hook is very handy, so is the built in pencil sharpener. Will this product last?

As luck would have it, I was offered a Bostitch nail gun and both the father-in-law (with his older tools) and the landlord were suitably impressed with this .Pros:+ Lightweight: lessens the fatigue issue when working in odd angles and for a lengthy period of time.+ Belt hook+ pneumatic = powerful enough for most projects+ Built-in pencil sharpener+ 100 brand nails included to start use right out of box+ Booklets and other instructions that help a novice like me get started+ Easy to load+ Built-in jam-free release mechanism+ Bostitch-patented small nose for precision placement+ Adjustable depth via dial-wheel for even more fine tuning and virtually invisible placement+ Selectable trigger-system allows single nail or multiple nail placement.+ Oil-free operation (I'm not quite sure what this translates to exactly but my landlord says this prevents oil stains on the wood).Cons:- I have very small hands so sometimes I had to tape the molding to my dresser and hold the gun both both hands.  My father-in-law and landlord had no trouble using this gun with a single hand.Overall it was relatively easy for a novice like me to use and it was actually quite fun. I am happy to say that the nails went where they were supposed to and that I did not accidentally nail myself to anything.  My father-in-law says that this nailer does not require the pushing motion for it to nail so eliminates accidentally marking softer and more delicate projects.

Besides weighing relatively little it also has a belt hook which keeps it handy for use.  The built in pencil sharpener is a nice feature as well.  It comes with 100 brad nails so you can start using it right out of the case.  Because the brads are small and this tool inserts them so neatly they&#8217;re all but invisible when installed.

As long as you have an idea how these things work, it is easy enough to figure out though.&#34;We had some molding that had come loose on a couple of doors, so we used this to get that nailed back in place.  This was brilliant for that use.There are two modes for this nail gun.  It shipped in sequential trip mode, which means that we put it up against where we wanted a nail, pulled the trigger (and released it... pulling and holding doesn't work), and it placed a single nail.The other mode, which we have not used at all, is contact trip mode.  You hold the trigger down, and every time you put it in contact with the material, it drives a nail.I have fairly small female hands.  My husband has quite large hands for a man.  My teen sons have fairly average sized men's hands.  All of us were able to handle this well, though it was a bit more awkward for me.

Having an oil-free product like this is also very nice when working with natural wood finish cabinetry and I also feel its worth mentioning how responsive the trigger system on this product is. I never need to hold more than 100 nails at once in the magazine so this is the right instrument for me. And coming in at under 3 lbs, it is also not cumbersome to haul around.

I really liked the contact nail mode where you don't have to pull the trigger for each nail as it nails on contact which is very fast and convenient. The nailer doesn't need oil so that was a very welcome feature for me because I do not like to breath oil mist that is often created by air tools that require oil. The 100 nail capacity is also another nice feature. The nailer is not too heavy so anyone can use it with ease.

This tool is about as nimble as a pneumatic nailer can be. I found it easy to place it in those smaller spaces, and it was simple to adjust the nailing depth for countersinking.While a &#34;no-oil&#34; design&#34; sounds great, I'm suspicious. My DeWalt is also a no-oil nailer, but eventually the head froze and I had to dose it with pneumatic lubricant to get it to work again. So far no trouble with the Bostitch, but time will tell.Finally, one small point: Bostitch really should throw in a full box of nails.

            " [\"A great brad nailer gun is something I've never found up to now. Years ago, I found a great buy on a compact light weight, easy to carry Craftsman compressor that included a nailer gun with some brad nails. What a difference a brad nailer makes when it comes to nailing woodwork, wood trim to the wall or any other finishing wood projects. Not only is it wonderful to have this type of precision nailing at your fingertips without damaging or marring the wood, but it is a huge time saver using a gun.The problems with the Craftsman Nailer gun became apparent very quickly- oil drips on the wood, nail jams that even my tools couldn't remove without damaging the gun's tip and the gun itself. The Craftsman brad nailer ended up in the trash very quickly. I then bought a DeWalt Brad Nailer which was a good buy- but not great. There were not many jams at first, but when the nail jammed or got bent, it took a bit of work to unjam the nails without damaging the gun. Also, the nailers that contain oil will eventually have oil drips ruining your wood at some point after using it for a time. The DeWalt doesn't jam as much as the Craftsman, but when it does, it's a time consuming operation to unjam it. A lesson learned is if a Brad Nailer comes with an Allen wrench- don't buy it. It's a warning that you will be unjamming your Nailing gun, instead of just nailing.The first thing I noticed is that this new Bostitch Smart Point 18 GA Brad Nailer Kit comes with NO Allen wrench. Instead of using tools to unjam the nails, there is a release mechanism for easy nail removal. I couldn't believe there is a brad nailer that has an easy release mechanism to remove a jam. You literally take a second to release the jam- without tools and taking apart the gun. This is the greatest feature ever- a huge time saver with no frustration. Then there is no oil- it is oil free so you'll never get oil stains on your wood.The gun itself has a selectable trigger system that easily converts from sequential to contact operation. Bostitich made the nose so small, you can fit it in the smallest of spaces and there is no need to compress the contact tip to actuate the tool. There is a Dial A Depth control for the most precise countersinking. The grip is super comfortable and the no-mar tip leaves your wood looking absolutely perfect. There is a pencil sharpener in the nailer, along with storage for more no-mar tips and a convenient belt hook also.The operating pressure with your compressor is between 70 to 120 p.s.i.g.. The nailer also has an easy quick connect plug to your compressor. Loading the magazine with brads is quick and there is a trigger lockout control for more safety. This is a great easy to use brad nailer kit that comes with the brad nailer, air fitting, sample nails, 3 no-mar tips, a carrying case, belt hook and instruction booklet. It does not come with any Allen wrenches and has no oil- making this Bostitch Smart Point Brad Nailer Kit superior over all the other brad nailers that come with Allen wrenches or need oil. With Bostitch's 7 Year Warranty and tiny nose Smart Point technology that allows this nailer to fit into any tiny space, you will never need any other Brad Nailer than this 5 STAR one.\"]\n",

The DIAL A DEPTH wheel allows you to either drive the brad flush with the surface, or to countersink it. (A great feature if you need to fill in the top of the brad.)  Bostitch trademarked their SMART POINT TECHNOLOGY, which is what they call the ultra small nose, that permits you to position the brad's point of entry with great precision, an important factor with all finishing work.  Something else that made using the gun easy---you don't need to push against your work surface to actuate the gun.  On the belt clip Bostitch even gives you the allen wrench you need to open the nail gun.  The gun grip has a rubber like surface, so it will stay steady in your hand.  Don't run it on more than 120 psi, is the only warning I can give.Even if you never used a nail gun before, you'll get the hang of it in no time.

My older guns have a safety catch on them so they need to be pressed to the surface in order to shoot. This new gun has a regulator that that can be set for either shoot or press - very nice to have the option. There is also the blower which clears a work area of dust, sawdust, etc and is more useful than you might imagine. And quite possibly one of the greatest additions is the 16 inch on center layout measurement guide along the base of the gun which can help you find a stud right there without having to stop and pull out a tape measure, pencil and snap a line.I really like the idea of this gun being airless, but this remains to be seen as I have yet to test it in cold weather. Here in Wyoming water has tendency to condense inside the gun on cold days. In the 18 years of use my older guns have had to be taken apart and cleaned of water and oil build up a few times.

All 3 times I was within 1-2 mm of where I had drawn the \"X\" as my target.  Not bad for a newbie.The 16\" guide is nice, but not practical in my case, where my studs are 24\" apart.  Not a big deal...just have to use a tape measure or some other guide.The belt hook is excellent!  Really solves the problem of being able to hang this tool on any tool belt.  Now I want to replace my drill/driver with a newer model that comes with this hook!In short, this is a very user friendly nailer.  First time users need not worry!  Depth is easy to adjust, and nail placement is so easy.  Definitely recommend it.  While it cost a bit of money, just one project with floorboards or crown molding and it\\'s paid off.']\n",

It's great for small jobs and small brads, but it's not the best for nailing molding, floor panels, etc.  This finish nailer is powerful and accurate.First off, it does not require oiling which is great.  There are a ton of features.  It's easy to load, and you can easily tell how many nails you have left in the chamber.  It has an air blowing button that will blow a burst of air out the nose of the nailer, so you can easily clear away dust/debris from your job as you go along.  It has both an auto firing mode, so all you have to do is tap the nail head against your work area and it will fire a nail, or it has the traditional trigger firing mode.The power adjustment is a bit tricky to get right.  You'll definitely want some scrap wood to test into to make sure you get the right depth of nail.  But once you find your desired setting, nails fired after that are consistent.This thing is built like a rock.  It has an adjustable belt loop so you can keep it at the ready as you work.  And it has a 16&#34; measurement gauge along the bottom of the nail track to easily find the proper distance between studs.Overall I'm very happy with this product and I think I will get years of use out of it.

It's accurate; it's not tiring to use, and it's oil-less. The FN nails that it uses are now readily available. Essentials such as depth setting are all there.

The total package is pretty hefty.Let's be clear on one thing: I don't think this tool is for beginners, but then beginners aren't likely to have a compressed air supply, either.

I used a neighbors compressor at his house, he is a carpenter by trade, and knows his stuff.  He was very impressed with this nailer and we both used it to install some baseboards in a garage conversion he was working on.  In fact I had a hard time getting him letting me take it with me when I left.  I have too many ideas already in mind at my house to let it go.  As soon as I get a new compressor I am going to replace a lot of old wallboards and molding and this is going to make the job so much easier and quicker.

Absolutely LOVE that the rear exhaust is now at the base of the handle and now out the rear of the nailer.  This used to be something I absolutely hated!!  I'd be trying to nail something, I'd have my face right in there to try and make sure the nail went in the right place - pull the trigger, then get compressed air shot right in my face.  The old one had a dial so you could direct the exhaust, but invariably, I'd change positions, or forget to check etc...and I'd get a shot of air to the face.  Hated this.

The design ,stability and color of this tool is all top notch.It\\'s true that this Bostitch  is a superior tool making it easier to counter sink, control depth of nails. I used a Porter Cable finish nailer before and it was hard to keep the depth of the nails consistent. The \\'Dial a Depth\\' control is very solid and it stays in place so you can make fine tune adjustments. This is the most important feature for me because I hate having to fix a nail that doesn\\'t set properly. Nail jams are rare, but easy to clear with a simple and sturdy latch mechanism.There are two options for firing the nails. You can set the gun in sequential trip mode or contact mode. If you need to make precise nail placements, the sequential trip mode is what you want to use. The \\'no mar\\' tip is sharp and provides for some degree of sensitivity so you know when you have enough pressure to pull the trigger when your ready.  Three additional no mar tips are stored neatly on the base of the nail clip.The Bostich also has a few neat bonus features: a good hook for a tool belt or ladder and a pencil sharpener! But the big surprise feature for me is the compressed air sprayer button. I use this all the time for clearing sawdust off my workspaces and saws and other tools. Also there is also a fold out gauge that makes it super easy to measure 16\" on center for running baseboard/crown molding.The Bostich is very sturdily built. I would not say it is ultralight but it is easy to hold and is well balanced in my hand. The angled nail clip also makes  it easier to line up your shots as opposed to the 90 degree clip on my older Porter Cable. I am super happy with this tool and I expect it will last a long time. The tool was ready to go right out of its case (which unlike so many other tool cases is very easy to refit the tool into).

For me, the important thing is ease of use and availability of compatible nails. First, I was surprised at how easy this tool is to use. I'm not a professional woodworker, so production speed is not a factor, but this is a very fast tool that rarely jams, and when it does it is easy and quick to clear. This nailer is also quite light, so when holding it overhead for, say, door and window molding, my arm does not get fatigued. As others have rightly pointed out, it is very accurate. As a seasoned painter, I've painted plenty of new houses, and one of my peeves has been marks left by air nailers, which I presume arises from &#34;bump&#34; nailing or carelessly pressing the gun too hard into bare pine trim, which is very soft prior to painting. This nailer has not left any such marks. It counter-sinks nails perfectly, leaving a tiny hole to fill.Being a relatively new product (as of June 2014), I was afraid that the proper &#34;FN&#34; nails might be difficult to find. I needn't have worried. My local hardware store carries both the FN nailers and a variety of nails to fit. This may not be true everywhere, but I suspect it is only a matter of weeks or a few months before all hardware outlets will carry these nails.Having looked at a few other reviews, I am happy that this is my first air nailer. It seems Bostitch has refined their product and eliminated many of the drawbacks of older models and brands. I find this tool to be perfectly adequate for my needs, and if I were a professional woodworker, I feel confident that it would continue to serve my needs. Heartily recommended.\"]\n",

WE have seen that as people swap out equipmentWe did not have any jams while testing it but I know all guns will jam eventually. Mainly with the 100 count cartridge it can handle. The release area we opened anyway does not need a tool to use it so that allows you to clear the jam even when up on the ladder.This is definitely going to be our gun of choice for small finishing work.

If you need the zip protection offered by this case you might not mind, but if space is a premium in your tool area (or you like to slip knives into an apron pocket) the extra bulk is annoying.

To be honest, I only wanted it for the tech-factor of having a touchless toilet, but I suppose it also helps keep things sanitary by eliminating the need to touch the flush handle.Installing the product isn't difficult, but it requires patience and small hands. While this device simply clips to the inside of the toilet tank (which is easy enough to do), you will then need to attach a very small chain between the device and the flush mechanism in your tank. The chain needs to not have too much or too little slack, and the clips that attach the chain to the device are finicky. You will probably need two hands to do that, and if your toilet tank is small, it becomes very difficult. You technically have the option to have both this device and the manual flush handle attached at the same time; however, I found that in my Kohler toilet, there was no good way to do this, so I simply removed the flush handle and covered the hole with the included cover plate.Once installed, it works as advertised. You hold your hand above the toilet just above where this device is, and the device pulls the chain, causing the toilet to flush. I found that I have to wave my hand pretty close to the top of the tank for it to work (about 1-2 inches above the surface). I tried to adjust the device (you are able to raise and lower it), but I couldn't get it to work any better.There is one other issue I've encountered: phantom flushes. On a near-daily basis, the toilet will flush itself. This happens at all times of day or night, and I can't figure out why it's happening. This wastes water, and can be a bit unnerving when you know you are home alone and you suddenly hear a toilet flush in your house.In sum, if you are truly concerned about germs on the flush handle, this could be an option for you. However, as a piece of technology, it's not really worth the &#34;upgrade.&#34;\"]\n",

Modern low-flow toilets do not usually &#34;drain the tank&#34;; the flapper on my Totos closes after it empties only part of the tank, dispensing about 1 gallon on a 1.28 gallon-per-flush toilet and a little more on a 1.6 gallon-per-flush toilet.  Hold my handle down for the 4-5 seconds this thing takes to cycle and you will virtually drain the 3+ gallon tank.  This will turn a Watersense toilet into a water-waster.

Both lights are very similar in features.Typically LED lights have a consistent light output through their life, unlike their incandescent counterparts which deteriorate in terms of light output over time. LEDs have a general life expectancy of 50,000 hrs but their driver electronics usually fail before the LEDs do.

At 2700K, it looks just like incandescent light (even when compared side-by-side).This bulb's 650 lumens look brighter than the 65W incandescents it replaces (which are rated at 700 lumens), all the more so because incandescents' output progressively decreases with usage. The bulb itself is a little brighter to look at directly, but not painfully bright like some LEDs-- I have it over a white ceramic sink, and it doesn't glare off the ceramic like I experienced with the Ecospiral brand (a 3000K lamp). There's no discernible buzz or noise from this LED.Construction feels solid, but it's not the heaviest LED BR30 I've used (but it's much heavier than an incandescent R30). The base is smaller than any of my BR30 CFLs. The 9W consumption is a nice decrease from the 14-15W used by the CFLs, and the lowest of any of my BR30 LEDs (the rest are 10W). Turn-on is instant on a normal switch (I didn't try a dimmer).If you're reading LED reviews, I don't have to extol their virtues: low power consumption, no hazardous materials inside, no UV emission, instant-on, extremely long life. LEDs are now almost always the best choice in lighting, held back only by initial cost. Note that the LED market is evolving rapidly at this point, so today's top-rated item might be in the middle-of-the-pack in a few months. Check for newest reviews as well as compare the many different models available on Amazon.There's an unusually long 5 year warranty, and an expected lifespan of 25,000 hours.

The end of the bulb is plastic, and not glass.  The bulbs came packaged in a nice, protective box.Unlike most fluorescent bulbs these bulbs turn on instantly to full brightness... and bright they are!

You don't have to worry about that with these bulbs, they are definitely equivalent to 60 watts.  The bulbs give off an even light pattern without concentrating the majority of light in one direction.  The color of light they give off is similar to a fluorescent.  It's a bit cool, but agreeable.All 6 of the bulbs worked perfectly out of the box.  I've installed then in lamps, wall fixtures, and into an enclosed outdoor fixture.  So far I've had no issues, but I will update this review as need be.A couple of things to keep in mind is that they are not meant to be used with dimmers, and the base of the lamp gets very hot to the touch.All in all... energy efficient, bright, and quick lighting.\"]\n",

The energy usage is lower than a CFL - but switching from CFL to LED is not quite as dramatic a reduction in the lighting bill as switching from incandescent to even CFL is.I would recommend changing as many lights over to LED as possible - they look great in the wall sconces, bathroom fixtures, and lamps.  The light is a soft white, so it doesn't have the old LED super bright look.  Great for home.Switching from incandescent saved about $15 per month on the light bill and it seems just 6 LEDs have lowered the bill another $5 or so per month on average.

I find it to put out a very white light and to work fine with a dimmer, but to be a bit large for most household uses.This bulb is a large flood light bulb, being about twice as long as a conventional LED bulb. The size is a major factor to consider. It works fine when dimmed, and it throws a light which is pretty bright in color - very white, but not stark. This is not a warm light at all, but then a flood light application would normally be expected to be bright. The light strength (when not dimmed) and color is good for reading and is quite steady. It is not for outdoor use unless housed in a water tight enclosure.The only drawback to this bulb is the design itself. Where in a standard house does one need a flood light that can be dimmed? Floodlights are normally used to provide a lot of light; in some ways dimming one doesn't make a lot of sense. There may be cheaper alternatives that don't dim, and there are smaller bulbs for general household use. I'm using it in the living room, in a standing lamp. It works, but the bulb is visible above the shade, so it throws more light than might be desired. I would not order it again for this use. I have small recessed floodlights in the bedroom, but this is too large to fit.

Incandescent floods on the same circuit come on immediately, while these take an extra half-second to catch up.  Hardly noticeable, though, so really not an issue to me.What &#34;IS&#34; an issue is that everyone once in a while one of these LED bulbs does not come on.  The incandescents on the circuit all do fine, but for reasons I've yet to determine, the one LED occasionally remains unlit.  I can turn off the switch, come back five minutes later, hit the switch, and then the LED bulb works just fine.  But, for some reason, it is occasionally inconsistent.My home has a plethora of these canned spotlights in the ceiling, so I was hoping that the LEDs could save me big time on my electric bill, but at this juncture, I'm thinking I'll not switch totally over to the LEDs --- I'll keep burning a few incandescents so I have some guaranteed lighting -- just in case all the LEDs decide to be finicky one day.\"]\n",

They are BRIGHT, and unlike incandescent, CFL, halogen, and other types of light bulbs, these TCP light bulbs don't get hot -- merely warm -- when they're turned on for long periods. That is a sure sign that these light bulbs are very energy efficient as most of the energy is converted to light and not dissipated as heat. Replacing your regular light bulbs with these will definitely help lower your energy bills.These light bulbs are dimmable. They can be used with a regular dimmer. However, they don't dim down to a soft amber glow like traditional incandescent light bulbs. The color temperature remains at 2700K even when dimmed all the way down. Additionally, the dimming isn't very gradual; it occurs in very noticeably discrete levels of brightness.Note that these are BR30-styled flood lights. They are bigger than regular light bulbs (a bit longer and wider) and are best suited for use in recessed light fixtures on the ceiling. If you plan on using them on lamps, do note that because of their longer profile, these light bulbs will only work well in lamps with longer lamp shades.---The dimming is a bit of a letdown, but in all other respects, these light bulbs definitely deliver. They are bright and energy-saving. If you don't plan on using these with a dimmer, I'd HIGHLY recommend them.\"]\n",

Side-by-side, this bulb's 2700K light has similar warmth as the incandescent. The bulb itself is a little brighter to look at directly, but not painfully bright like some LEDs. There's no discernible buzz or noise from the lamp.Construction feels lighter than other LEDs I've used (but much heavier than an incandescent R30). The base is smaller than any of my BR30 CFLs. The 10W consumption is a nice decrease from the 14-15W used by the CFLs. Turn-on is near instant, though I noticed one of the two bulbs sometimes took a half-second to power up. The other bulb came on just as fast as the incandescent. At power-off, they take about 2 seconds to fade completely to dark.If you're reading LED reviews, I don't have to extol their virtues: low power consumption, no hazardous materials inside, no UV emission, instant-on, extremely long life.

They were much brighter at the lowest setting than the incandescents were. So if you're going for very low mood lighting, it might be worth noting that these may be a bit brighter.Another thing to point out is that some LEDs will interfere with your TV antenna signal, in the rare event that you have one. We're trying to switch over to LEDs, and have had problems with one specific light bulb brand. So far, I haven't noticed it with these, but that may vary.Another positive to these is that they're soft white, which somewhat mimics the light/look of incandescent bulbs.

The Friendly Swede's Premium Paracord Kit - DIY Paracord Bundle has a Lifetime Warranty, quality parts, and perfectly priced, but the directions lacked clarity particularly when using two different colors of paracord.THE DIY EXPERIENCE:I gave this kit to my teenage daughter who is very crafty and bright. She decided to make a bracelet, but quickly found the directions with this kit lacking when two colors of paracord were used. She ended up researching on the internet a bit to clarify the 'general' instructions for paracord bracelet building, and eventually completed a bracelet that looked as good as the complete paracord bracelets that I've been sent by The Friendly Swede. Like this one:The Friendly Swede (TM) 9 Inch Extra Wide Dragon Tongue Premium 350 lb Paracord Survival Bracelet and Adjustable Monkey Fist (Diameter:1.5 Inch) Paracord Keychain in Retail Packaging - Lifetime Warranty.After the bracelet was completed she was really happy with the end result and the quality of the materials used. I asked her how many projects she could complete by using the kit and she told me that would depend upon which projects were chosen, and if they were bracelets, how long the bracelets needed to be - determining how much paracord would be used. Our wrists are small, so she thought she could make at least two, if not three bracelets from this one kit.CONCLUSION:This is an item I will be giving as a gift to my niece and nephew for Christmas this year. It brings together a fun do-it-yourself project with contemporary, urban casual styling that's both popular and functional. The addition of the various quality accessories (keychain, carbiener, clasps...) gives great value to this kit, as does the lifetime warranty and excellent customer service provided by The Friendly Swede.I would give it 5 stars for the value contained in this package and the quality of the components, but the directions need to be revisited and reworked for clarity. Perhaps The Friendly Swede could do a 'how to' video series for these types of products and put the link to them in the next set of directions?NOTE: I was given this product by the seller in exchange for my honest review.\"]\n",

            " [\"We love spending time on the deck in the summer, but our lighting is terrible.  The former owner installed spotlights and we haven't gotten around to replacing them with something more subtle so this little lantern is the perfect alternative.  It's USB rechargeable and the charge lasts all evening.  The light is warm and strong enough to cast a pleasant light without being too bright.  It's also dimmable, but we have found that the highest setting is the best for our purposes.  It has a handle so you can carry it easily or hang it.  It's great for backyards, but my in-laws saw it and ordered one for their Airstream, too.  This is a great little lantern.\"]\n",
            " ['I have the earlier version of this lamp and have been using it for quite some time with excellent results. This new version retains all the good features of the previous one, plus adds on a few new ones.Although this is pretty compact (measures about 5.25 inches at the base and stands about 3.5 inches tall) it puts out quite a bit of light. Properly positioned, it&#8217;s more than adequate for reading when it&#8217;s set to the brightest level. When dimmed to it&#8217;s lowest level (it can be dimmed by holding down the touch-sensitive power switch) it makes for a great night light.I like the versatility of how it can be used. You can set it flat on a table (there are four non-slip feet that hold it in place) or you can hang it up either from the top or the bottom with the built-in handle/hooks. The handle/hooks fold flat when not in use to keep them out of the way.Like the older version this has an internal battery that can be recharged using a standard USB cable. The LED lights are pretty efficient, so the internal battery gives it a good 4 hours of run time. A new feature is the ability to run this from AAA batteries (requires 3, and they are not included). I use the internal battery since that&#8217;s easier to deal with, and it can be recharged using a powerbank for when I&#8217;m not near a power source or there&#8217;s a power outage. But, the flexibility of using standard AAA cells is a nice addition.The build quality is pretty good. It&#8217;s all plastic, but has enough of a heft to deal with being knocked around a bit. The older model I have has been dropped a few times and still works fine.The only improvement I wish they had made is with the bottom hook. It&#8217;s still all-plastic and rather thin plastic at that. A metal hook would have been a better design for durability. While I have not broken the bottom hook on my old one, I use it mainly as a desk lamp, so the hook has not seen much use. It if did, I&#8217;d probably would have snapped it by now.The hook issue aside, this is a great lamp for camping, for power outages, or just an easy way to have a bedside lamp without having to deal with a power cord. Highly recommend.[Sample provided for review]']\n",

As in the item description, it will work if you have charged this by the supplied USB cable or you can also place 3 AAA batteries in this for 4 hours on light.The great thing about having the AAA batteries also to use this lantern is on a camping trip in a tent, there are no electrical outlets or power to charge this. So what I did is I took this on a camping trip and had the first 4 hours that I used because I had charged this by USB cable in my laptop. As it was fully charged, I got 3.75 hours of use (I had in on bright much of the time).When I used up my internal charged battery, I inserted 3 AAA batteries and got 3.50 hours of continious use. (So I would always have light, I brought 6 AAA batteries with me and this kept me in light when I needed it).To turn off the light. Press and HOLD DOWN the white built in power button on the front bottom. This is your combo dimmer switch/on/off switch.Note: To turn it off keep holding down the Power Button, this will take about 30 seconds. I did not find that it went 100 percent off while the batteries were fresh or the internal battery had a charge. But is is only only at about 2 percent (very low).This is the only thing that I DID NOT like about this lantern so I give it 4.5 stars rounded off to the nearest decimal at 5 stars.One more thing: Lantern is perfect to keep on hand for power outages such as in storms, etc.Lantern provided for testing and reviewing purposes.']\n",

I then discovered that the battery compartment is an extra source of power in the event of a prolonged outage when you can no longer charge it. That impressed me because I still have vivid memories of being without electricity for over a week when the hurricanes came through my neck of the woods ten years ago.However, the reason why I am purchasing more is this lantern draws such a negligible amount of current when the USB charger is plugged it and the lights are activated, that it is an economical way to provide ambient light in the evening. Plus the hanger makes it handy to actually hang these on my patio or even off a curtain rod.Another feature I love the the ability to control the illumination from bright to dim. Note, though, that even at the brightest setting this is not exactly a reading light.  It is designed to work upside down as a lantern or rightside up as a table light, so it's versatile as well.Rarely do I instantly fall in love with a product, but in the case of this light I did and have enthusiastically recommended it to friends and family. That is the highest endorsement that I can give it and the most sincere as well.\"]\n",

I have tried several different mini-lanterns, but have found them to generally be under-powered, and to have a short battery life. This one is different. It is really bright, and can provide a usable amount of light for a small to medium size room. I have also been impressed with the battery life, which gives multiple hours of bright light. The manufacturer claims 4 hours of light, but the unit I have was going strong after 8 hours on a single charge. The lantern runs off a rechargable internal battery. You charge it up with a standard USB cable hooked to your computer. You can also power the light off AAA batteries, but I see no reason to purchase batteries in that the internal rechargeable ones are completely sufficient.Besides being useful for power outages, I also this being ideal for camping trips.

            " ['The G7 Power Incline LED 10-watt (60-watt incandescent analog) is an LED bulb with a shape very similar to traditional incandescent bulbs. The approximate replacement for a traditional 60-watt bulb, its 2700K light (at 740 lumens) places it in the area of \"warm white\" bulbs familiar to users of incandescent lighting.As with all LEDs used in standard fixtures, it is significantly heavier than an incandescent (this bulb weights 4.6 ounces, 3.6 ounces more than the incandescent it replaced). This is primarily due to the heat sink that takes up about half of the bulb\\'s body area above the socket.G7\\'s packaging indicates 22.8 years estimated life at three hours of daily use (run it 24/7, and my math says you\\'ll get more way more than eight years of operation).Don\\'t let the sticker price scare you. The 10-year warranty exceeds this bulb\\'s predicted life; combine that with a more than 80% reduction in energy usage (vs. incandescent), and you quickly become \"penny-wise\" in smartly comparing LED vs. incandescent.Like every G7 product I\\'ve used, this is a bulb to select with confidence.Note: This item provided for review purposes (but I have purchased other products from them, and will continue to!).']\n",
            " [\"G7 sent me one of these bulbs for review.The LED tech seems to be evolving and improving at a rapid pace and this bulb is a good illustration. This 60W incandescent equivalent produces a light very similar with that of the incandescent it's meant to replace and, unlike earlier models that were larger and heavier, it's very much the size and shape of the 'old tech' equivalent. It's still heavier because of the heat sink but it should fit everywhere a 60W incandescent would. As expected from an LED, it turns on and off and it achieves optimal brightness instantly.While the price is not... 'cheap', G7 claims huge savings over time and that may very well happen if the bulb lasted for many years and it replaced a power inefficient incandescent that had to be on for several hours every day. I can't comment or speculate on durability at this time but everything else about this bulb seems to be right and it does appear to be a well-made, quality product.\"]\n",

            " [\"I've become a huge fan of G7 Power bulbs, and this 10 watt bulb (the approximate brightness of an incandescent 60 watt bulb) is no exception.  It has a standard base to use in most kinds of lamp fixtures.  I find that this version is somewhat smaller and lighter than older style bulbs of the same brightness.When I was first introduced to LED bulbs, I had a tough time trying to decipher the terminology.  Because LED bulbs use much less wattage than incandescent bulbs; therefore, using watts as a measure of brightness is not appropriate.  Instead, LED manufacturers use &#34;lumens,&#34; a truer measurement of brightness.  This bulb, at 740 lumens, gives as much light as a 60W bulb but by using only 10 watts of electricity.  The shape of the bulb is indicated by the letter/number name, in this case A19:  the standard pear-shape bulb.  This bulb mimics very closely an incandescent A19 in shape and size.This G7 Power bulbs comes with a 10-year warranty.  Although not enough time has passed to determine whether LED bulbs last as long as predicted, they should last well beyond the current CFL bulbs and, of course, remaining incandescent types. Obviously, the company believes in its product.  I've been using G7 Power bulbs for years, and none have burned out.This bulb is dimmable.  The beauty of it is that dimming it doesn't make the bulb buzz or flicker.  Like other LED bulbs, it cannot be used in a completely enclosed fixture because it must dissipate the heat.  Although it runs cooler than older versions, the technology is not quite to the point where you can enclose one.If you think the LED light is harsh, think again.  The light from this bulb is the closest I've seen to incandescent soft-white bulbs. I've become to prefer LED light, in fact, because it seems clearer and cleaner to my eyes.

            " ['Of all the LED bulbs I have this is probably a favorite.  It looks and acts like my old-fashioned lightbulbs.  I tried this bulb along with a 60 watt one and there was little lighting discrepancy.  Oftentimes I\\'ve had some noticeable differences, so much so that people have commented on it.  I\\'ve ended up using the old-fashioned lightbulbs when I need two of them because of this issue.  I definitely like the durability factor of the G7s.  There won\\'t be any turning off the power to get a socket out with a pair of needle-nosed pliers.  Instant start up and the fact that this is a dimmable makes this bulb about as good as it gets.With the advent of The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, otherwise known as the \"Energy Bill,\" I replaced all of my lightbulbs with CFLs. The CFLs or Compact Fluorescent Bulbs used 75% less energy and were compliant. The replacement seemed sensible, and indeed it was ... at the time. I got a nice rebate for using the bulbs, but soon regretted the decision on more than one level. The bulbs proved to be fragile and within a year a full quarter of them blew. This created yet another problem that the Environmental Protection Agency is now well aware of.The CFLs do have approximately 4 milligrams of mercury per bulb and need disposal at a hazardous-waste facility. Just how many people make use of the disposal option and how many simply chuck them in the trash? I\\'ve flipped a switch and had three blow out at once. LEDs do meet the standards the Energy Independence and Security Act imposes and meets Part 15 of the FCC rules. There are several other nice things about these bulbs and one is that they are long-lasting. Unless we experience a tremendous power surge or any other unforeseen electrical issue I expect this bulb to last.  I\\'ve been using a wide variety of G7 bulbs and none have broken or suddenly blown out.If you\\'re into energy savings and want to protect the environment LED bulbs are the way to go. I also like the longevity factor of 22.8 years, a real plus in my book. The CFLs, which are problematic do cost less, but will only last for 10,000 hours (if you\\'re lucky). I\\'m setting this bulb aside until I get its twin so they\\'ll \"match.\" The bulb is not at all delicate and in fact, is ultra-sturdy. I needed one that wouldn\\'t break easily in an outbuilding where I\\'m moving things around all the time and I\\'ve broken more than one bulb.

If you get a color temperature that is too \"cool\" the light looks harsh and blueish.

            " [\"I received one of these as a review sample and have had it in use for over ten hours already. It runs cool, even after the continuous run time. Part of that is due to the large heat sink (the finned part of the base as shown in the product photo).Since there are ample specs on this page I am not going to repeat them. I will say that the 2700 degrees Kelvin color rating is perfect for rooms where you want to accentuate warmed decor or a cozy mood. It's definitely not the best for reading, but the diffused light it emits is pleasant. The 740 lumens places the brightness at just under the equivalent 60 Watt bulb which this is designed to replace. Those are typically in the 800 lumen range, but it's still close.The main value of this bulb is it consumes a sixth of the kilo Watt hours of a normal 60 Watt bulb. If you used this for six hours per day at 11 cents per kilo Watt hour it would cost $2.42 per year to operate. A true 60 Watt bulb would cost $14.52 for the same period, so this bulb actually pays for itself in less than a year. When you factor in the significantly longer service life, it is not at all pricey.\"]\n",

            " [\"If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive dimmable LED that is a 60 W incandescent equivalent, that gives off the orange-ish glow of an incandescent, the G7 is a fantastic option.The light is even, doesn't flicker and the dimming function works much the same as an incandescent in the same configuration.Unlike CFLs, there is no mercury, so they could be disposed of normally. Of course, given the 22.8 year rated life span (assumes 3 hours a day, every day), it won't be making it into the trash anytime soon.In terms of the cost, yes, this bulb is more expensive than a 60 W incandescent bulb UP FRONT. In the long run, however, here's how it plays out for electric costs:60 W incandescent $.25 per bulb. Each bulb has roughly 3000 hours of life, or roughly 3 years at 3 hours a day. You would need $2 worth of bulbs. This STILL doesn't get to the G7 price, right? Well then let's look at actual power usage.With a 60 W incandescent you would consume $28.91 a year in electricity at $.11 per kWh using it 3 hours a day. This LED bulb for the same amount of time, would cost you $4.82. You would be saving almost $25 in electric usage in the first year alone on the LED side. Mulitply that savings across the 30,000 hour life rating of the LED and you would save $570 (over the 22.8 years). To me, switching to LED just makes sense now that they are just about on price parity with CFLs. I doubt we'll ever get LEDs as cheap as incandescents, but you save so much money over the life of the product it just makes sense.And why would I want LEDs over CFLs? Mercury. The reality is, all CFLs have mercury in them. This means, from an environmental perspective, you aren't legally allowed to just throw them in the trash, they are supposed to be disposed of properly. The LEDs, be almost price equal, win just because I can toss them in the trash without too much concern for mercury leaching into ground soil.Highly recommended.I received a free sample from G7 for review purposes.\"]\n",

Hall seems as if he was born to play the role of Dexter.  Every season there seems to be one central character that Dexter must hunt down, amongst various other serial killers and murders that end up getting chopped up on his table.  This season follows Dexter&#8217;s pursuit of the Ice Truck Killer&#8212;a sadistic serial killer that chops bodies into pieces after draining all of their blood.  He&#8217;s named the Ice Truck Killer because it is believed that he drives around in an ice truck before dumping the bodies off.  Great pilot season.  If you have not seen this show, this is definitely one you do not want to miss.',\n",
              " \"This isn't one of those shows or movies about a serial killer who just does it for fun.  Dexter Morgan targets people very specifically and only those whom he believes have crossed a line or violated one of his standards.  For example, Dex would never molest or kill a child, so he kills a man who has done such things to choir boys.  This is not a defense of Dex, just a clarification.What makes him even more complex is that he did not suffer abuse at the hands of his loving foster parents; he maintains a good relationship with his sister, a cop; he works as a forensic examiner for the police; he fakes emotions as best he can with  his girlfriend and her kids; and feels nothing at all, most of the time, unless it's a sense that he must get rid of someone.Michael C. Hall's performance and voiceover work are very strong. He's stretched out further than he could with his character on the late, great Six Feet Under.\",\n",
              " 'If you\\'re reading this you either are 1) a fan of the show 2) want to know more about it to see if it will appeal to you. Michael C. Hall (\"Six Feet Under\") plays Dexter a vigilante serial killer. By day Dexter works as a splatter analyst in the police department using blood patterns to help determine exactly how a crime occurred.We have a true anti-hero as the focus of the series--a serial killer who almost seems to have a conscience because he focuses on dealing out justice (and focusing his urges)to those he feels are evil. His father a police officer instilled a code to help him direct his \"urges\" and distinguish between good and evil.Showtime has attempted to improve the quality of their shows and their DVD releases with some mixed results. I found the image quality to be anything but subpar for a DVD. It\\'s a very good transfer. Is it high definition? No, but this isn\\'t an HD-DVD and the quality for a standard DVD is very good although there are some digital compression issues that crop up occasionally.The one complaint I have is simple--no chapter indexing where you can see specific scenes for each episode. Sure you can skip through it by hitting the next button but it\\'s kind of unusual in this day and age for new shows to NOT have this. The second is minor and others have pointed it out--the menu is a very basic design that looks like it could have been done by an amateur.You also have to reset audio for each disc as you watch it for 5.1 as it automatically defaults to 2.o. To be sure many of these are minor points but they do contribute to the enjoyment of the show if handled well.The special features are an improvement over some previous Showtime series but far from perfect. We get two episodes of the excellent Showtime drama \"Brotherhood\". We also get \"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation\" a very good featurette that focuses on splatter analysis and what it reveals about a murder. It ties in to \"Dexter\" because that\\'s what Dexter does for a living on the show and it also helps him to break a number of cases. We also get a commentary track that I haven\\'t listened to yet as well as an online link to watch two episodes of the new Showtime series \"The Tudors\" and a pdf file with the first two chapters of the new Dexter novel. I suspect that \"The Academy of Blood: A Killer Course\" is along with the DEXTER novel excerpt buried in the DVD-Rom portion of the disc. You won\\'t be able to watch it or access it on a regular DVD player which is just plain sloppy as this isn\\'t indicated on the package.We also get biographies for the actors. While the extras here (including two commentary tracks on the set are very good, the show could have used more commentary tracks and the involvement of star Michael C. Hall on at least one of them. Also, the special features really need to be more clearly indicated as to whether they are DVD accessible, PC accessible and where you might find them on the disc.Minor Plot Spoilers:Dexter\\'s father a police officer recognized early on his son\\'s proclivities and tried to give him moral guidence and boundaries so that he can function in our world but, more importantly, use his \"skills\" to hunt down those that prey on others.Dexter is conflicted--he knows that he\\'s not normal and he also knows he doesn\\'t fit in (he has difficulty with emotions having to fake his way through it). He also recognizes what he is and how his father tried to shape him into something \"better\".When he goes toe-to-toe with the Ice Truck Murderer and tries to track down this nasty serial killer he gets a glimpse into his own soul but also recognizes that unlike his evil doppleganger he can choose his actions and not just act on his instincts.END OF PLOT SPOILERS:Overall, Dexter is a terrific show. The second season has also gotten off to a bold start. The first season used the novel DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER as a starting point. For the second season the writers/producers have chosen to depart from the novels which should make for an interesting move. This is a solid set that could be improved with future seasons.',\n",
              " '\"Dexter\" is built on an intriguing premise: a man with antisocial personality disorder experiences murderous impulses but lives by a code - he can only kill murderers.  Kind of a twisted play on Freud\\'s concept of sublimation.  The series didn\\'t initially appeal to me, but overall I\\'m pleased that I stuck with the first season.  Michael C. Hall plays the titular character, a forensic expert in blood splatter.  He works alongside a group of detectives assigned to some of most brutal Miami murders; one of these cops is Dexter\\'s adopted sister, Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter).  Dexter was adopted as a child by a Miami cop (the now deceased Harry Morgan) who recognized that Dexter was antisocial.  Instead of allowing Dexter to go down the path of juvenile delinquency (and inevitably murder), Harry developed a code for him - you can kill but only under certain circumstances.  Harry also encouraged Dexter to do things to make him seem normal, such as dating, to help him hide his true nature and go undetected.  Most episodes feature Dexter stalking a serial killer, with a season long plot involving Dexter\\'s fascination with the \"Ice Truck Killer.\"The series features excellent writing and direction, which helps make the somewhat unbelievable premise feel realistic.  The acting also is top-notch.  Hall does a nice job of making Dexter charming and likeable (so that we can believe that he can fit in at work and his relationships) while also adding a bit of edge through his lack of true emotion, superficial charm, and violent impulses.  We can sense that evil lurks just below the surface, kept in check only by his adherence to his code.  It\\'s a solid portrayal of an extreme case of antisocial personality disorder, and the series isn\\'t afraid to make its protagonist dark and somewhat frightening.  The supporting cast is also terrific, with C.S. Lee scoring as Vince Masuka, Dexter\\'s lascivious co-worker who is a walking sexual harassment case.  Likewise, Sgt. Doakes (Erik King) helps lighten the mood as the only person who seems to know that Dexter is not the good guy he portrays.  I also enjoy the work of two \"Oz\" veterans - Lauren Velez as Dexter\\'s complicated Lieutenant, and David Zayas as Detective Angel Batista (perhaps Dexter\\'s closest \"friend\").Although I enjoyed the show, there were a few things I disliked about the first season.  Debra\\'s insecurity is highly grating, and the actress gives a twitchy, affected performance.  Dexter\\'s flashbacks to his days with Harry become extremely repetitive and unrealistic after awhile.  The first few episodes were difficult to watch, and Dexter came across as quite brutal; I was ready to give up on the series after these shows, but the character became more \"human\" in subsequent episodes.  Finally, the last two episodes of the season, which focused on the Ice Truck Killer case, were overly melodramatic and lead to a rather unsatisfying ending.  Although I approached the series with some trepidation and found it flawed, there\\'s enough to like about the Season 1 that I plan on watching Season 2 on DVD.',\n",

Veronica Mars, the movie, is essentially a love letter from the cast & crew to the fans.A long time ago, we used to be friendsBut I haven\\'t thought of you lately at all...It\\'s been roughly ten years since we last saw Veronica, back when she was a teenaged private eye poking her nose in everyone\\'s biz in Neptune, Cali. The movie\\'s opening sequence fills us in on what she\\'s been up to. Veronica is interviewing for a place in a prestigious New York law firm that especializes in dumping frivolous cases before they get to court. (So much for what would\\'ve been the 4th Season premise of her landing in the FBI.) Veronica confides that she got out of Neptune when she was 19, got herself a B.A. in psychology at Stanford, was near the top of her class in Columbia law. Interview over, Veronica hopes for the best.She claims that her amateur sleuthing days are in the rear view and her nosy disposition tamped down. And when her bad boy ex Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is implicated in murder and he calls her, pleading for her help, she assures her current beau that she\\'s only going to provide Logan with lawyery advise. So it\\'s back home for Veronica, a reunion with her ex with the baggage and a dive back into a posh but then scuzzy space redolent of leftover angst and reputations ruined and inner demons outed but never exorcised. That unknown murderer lurking in the midst - because it can\\'t possibly be Logan, right? - almost seems a footnote. Just another day in Neptune.The best bits about the television show get reincarnated. It\\'s still ultimately about the underdog, the perceived loser, putting one over the bullies. Very much intact is that marvelous father-daughter synergy between Kristen Bell and the fantastic Enrico Colantoni. Veronica and Logan\\'s relationship is still... complicated. Veronica still cracks wise. She\\'s still incredibly dogged. There\\'s huge gratification in catching up with a host of familiar faces. Everyone came back! Plus, there\\'s a surprise cameo or three. Okay, if you don\\'t know Veronica Mars from Bruno Mars, you won\\'t get it. But this isn\\'t about luring in the uninitiated. See, you\\'ve caught me in mid-celebration. I\\'m still gobsmacked that there\\'s a Veronica Mars movie, and I think we marshmallows suspected it wasn\\'t gonna make tons of money, but so what? Maybe tomorrow I\\'ll watch this again and then I\\'ll notice flaws. But that\\'s tomorrow. This movie is a collaborative labor of love among the filmmakers, the cast, and the ardent, mobilized fans. For now, I\\'m keeping it on the pedestal.The DVD\\'s bonus stuff:- \"By the Fans: The Making of the Veronica Mars Movie\" - a very cool documentary in which Rob thomas, Kristen Bell and the entire Veronica Mars cast take you from its record-breaking Kickstarter launch to pre-production to the first day on set and beyond! Includes a segment from the backers\\' perspectives as they show up as extras on the set (00:55:36 minutes long)']),\n",

What\\'s up with that?

Yes, terrorists have now attacked our imaginations.  Meanwhile, Cartman takes Kyle to court and Stan and Kyle are taken to the Pentagon for questioning.\"Imaginationland, Episode II\"--That opening dream sequence is from Monty Python.  The terrorists break down a wall and unleash the evil characters of our imagination and now imaginations are really running wild, especially when Cartman\\'s demented Christmas woodland critters show up.  Stan and Kyle help the feds break through the portal to Imaginationland but, just before the troops charge in, Kyle may finally have to pay his debt to Cartman.\"Imaginationland, Episode III\"--With the help of Butters, the good imaginary characters set out to battle the evil ones.  Kyle has to stop the Pentagon from destroying Imaginationland before the good characters have a chance to win.  Al Gore, however, might doom everyone when he sees the evil character from his imagination.  Oh, and the Cartman/Kyle bet finally gets settled...sort of.\"Guitar Queer-o\"--Great!

              "'With a pretty cool subterranean monster,Tremors(1990) was a fairly successful creature flick, which spawned three subsequent films.  Tremors the TV series, retains many of the original story elements, as events are mostly centered near the tiny settlement of Perfection, Nevada (Population 12), where the carnivorous sand worms known as &#8220;Graboids&#8221;, continue to threaten those residing in the area.  For those acquainted with the movies, the TV program has a very familiar feel, as Michael Gross resumes the role of Burt Gummer, a heavily armed survivalist type, with a passion for killing the creatures who are responsible for the death of his wife.Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, and Gross were the stars of the original movie, with Gross assuming the lead role in the sequels, as the gun happy Gummer was the ideal character to continue the battle to save Perfection.  With Gross as the producer, the TV series features a stubborn group of settlers, who are determined to stay, in spite of the danger.  Newcomer Tyler Reed (Victor Browne) arrives in Perfection, as the new owner of Desert Jack&#8217;s Graboid Adventure, and is quickly integrated into the community that includes Nancy Sterngood (Marcia Strassman), Rosalita Sanchez (Gladise Jimenez), and storekeeper Jodi Chang (Lela Lee).  Melvin Plugg (Robert Jayne) is a developer looking to buy out the residents, while the charismatic Dean Norris (Breaking Bad, Under the Dome) plays W.D. Twitchell, an official from the Department of the Interior.The stories are pretty creative, with some good action scenes, as the settlers are threatened by several variations of the beast, who are attracted to the heat of the human body.  In addition to head sandworm &#8220;el blanco&#8221;, and other Graboids, there are also &#8220;shriekers&#8221;, two legged creatures, that often attack in groups, and even a flying beast known as an &#8220;ass-blaster&#8221;.  The special effects by Encore Visual Effects, and Greg Nicotero&#8217;s KNB EFX Group, are often impressive, much better than you might expect for a TV program.When originally aired on the Sci Fi Channel, the 13 one hour episodes were broadcast out of order.  The DVD release presents them in the order they were intended to be.  The picture is full screen, with image quality being very good.  If you&#8217;re a fan of the Tremors franchise looking for a little more Graboid action, you will probably enjoy this short lived series, which is currently available at really low price.'"

              "\"Out of all the new comedies that have come out in the last ten years, Sunny is as the top of my list.  You need an affinity for quirky, offbeat humor to enjoy it, not to mention a high tolerance for raw language and sexual humor.  The first season consisted of just seven episodes, but established the core characters and operators of Paddy&#8217;s Pub; owners Dennis, Mac, and Charlie, and waitress/Dennis&#8217;s twin sister Dee.  In Season 2 (ten episodes), Danny Devito comes on board as Frank, Dennis and Dee&#8217;s dad.  The show&#8217;s creators (Rob McElhenney/ Mac; Glenn Howerton/Dennis; and Charlie Day/Charlie) are hilarious as actors, and also as writers.  Every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me.  It&#8217;s one of those great ensemble casts that&#8217;s incredibly balanced in terms of the personalities and comedic nature of each character, resulting in a consistently high level of quality in every episode.  These first two seasons have some of my favorites, including &#8220;Charlie Has Cancer,&#8221; &#8220;Charlie Got Molested,&#8221; &#8220;Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,&#8221; &#8220;Hundred Dollar Baby,&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody&#8217;s Ass.&#8221;  Like most fans of the show, I tend to favor the Charlie-themed episodes, and considering that he&#8217;s the only one so far to get movie roles and a gig hosting SNL, it&#8217;s clear how important he is as part of the cast.  But that&#8217;s not a knock against anyone else.  I can&#8217;t really imagine it continuing if they lost any of the key characters of Dennis, Dee, Mac, and Charlie, and even though Frank wasn't there in the beginning, it would definitley hurt the show to lose him.  As far as current TV comedies go, no one else is doing anything funnier than &#8220;Always Sunny,&#8221; and these first two seasons show it.\""

              "'This light-duty trimmer works well but struggles with heavier weeds.  The standardized interchangeable 18V batteries last just long enough, and the adjustable handle and length make it easy to configure for me or the GF to use with equal ease.  Assembly is easy, and the unit feels solid.I would have liked the lithium-ion model (charges faster, lighter, battery is less toxic than Ni-Cad) but at half-again the price, that wasn\\'t worth the extra cost.I also asked Black&Decker; how the NST2118 differed from the previousNST2018which is also sold on amazon (and well reviewed).  B&D; replied: \"The new NST2118 trimmer has the same key features as the NST2018 other than the guard and the aux handle. The unit is still supplied with (2) 18 volt batteries and one charger. No difference in job performance and run time.\"  So as far as I can tell, no reason to buy the older Ni-Cad model since they both sell for a similar price.I was an early adopter of rechargeable lawn equipment, and this NST2118 replaces my ancient CST2000 (circa mid-late 90s) with 12V Lead-Acid battery.  That old trimmer was much much heavier, with lower RPM, and non-adjustable handle/length.  I hope this new one lasts me just as long.  The new trimmer\\'s much lighter weight, redesigned trigger, and adjustable length and handle are much easier on my arms, although the unit does still transmit vibration up the shaft.I need to use both battery packs to do my normal string-trimming on 1/3 of an acre: around beds, curbs, pavement, edge of house, weeds on driveway.  This works fine for me but those of you with larger properties should look at a different model.Other than power, my only quibbles were imprecise machining on the plastic of the shield (it was hard to wedge into place), and the edging guard not locking into place (it extends to maintain height for edging, but the weight of the trimmer pressing it into the ground causes it to recede back into the unit).So for light duty, this is a great little trimmer that could be more powerful, but the price and features are right.  Those looking for heavier use might do better with one of Black & Decker\\'s 24V or 36V models, or the Lithium-Ion powered models (all more expensive).  Commercial-duty users should stick to gas.For my purposes, this trimmer works very well, and is Recommended.'"

              "'I am a big fan for digitizing documents for archiving. I have been doing so for more than 10 years. On hardware part, I have used several consumer level scanners from Brothers and Canon. On software part, I use PaperPort pro software to control scanners and also for post-scanning document editing purpose. The biggest problem of consumer level scanner is \"SLOW\". I am very happy to try out this i2900, a business class scanner.The i2900 itself does not have big internal memory buffer. The scanned image is saved in the internal memory first and then passed to PC through the USB cable. When the internal memory is filled up, i2900 will pause and wait for its internal memory buffer to be freed up. Once its memory buffer is freed up, it then automatically resumes scanning. So, the overall scanning speed depends on (1) the resolution setting, (2) desktop PC capability and (3) connection speed between PC and the scanner.For scanning with black & white or grey with resolution at 300dpi (or below), the scanner itself is not the speed bottleneck. The PC and connection speed between scanner and PC are the speed bottleneck. For scanning with resolution above 300dpi, then scanner itself can also play a role to impact the overall speed. My PC is a relative new Intel iCore 7 quad-core desktop with 12G memory. The connection between scanner and PC is through the new USB3. If I scan with black & white or grey at 300dpi or below, the scanner can scan hundreds or papers without pausing. And the overall scanning speed is close to the claimed 60 pages per minute. But if I can at 400dpi, from time to time, the scanner does pause. At higher resolution settings (above 400dpi), the slow \"scanning\" part by itself drags down the overall speed.The capability of scanning double side documents \"simultaneously\" is a big time saving. After scanned data is sent from scanner to PC, the software run in the PC will then convert the scanned images to PDF, searchable PDF or JPEG format...etc (per user\\'s selection). Converting to the searchable PDF file is a heavy duty task to the PC, especially with high resolution settings. For 300dpi, my CPU usage is around 40% (a iCore 7 quad-core CPU with 12G ram). For 600dpi setting, my CPU usage is at the 95+%. So, the PC (not the scanner) is the speed bottleneck on this part. Or, you can save the image into non-searchable PDF for faster processing time.I can not comment on the quality of color scanning. This business-class scanner is mainly for scanning \"big amount\" of documents fast with good quality. For my document archiving purpose, I stick to 300dpi with either black & white or grey modes. The black-and-white scanning quality (at 300dpi) is very impressive. Once a while, I do use the \"grey\" mode if the original document has a lot of faded marks. The final file size of the black-and-white with 300dpi resolution is very small. This is very good when I need to email out the scanned documents.During the one month ownership, I have scanned more than 1000 pages of documents, the document sources include regular 8x11 printouts, legal size papers, magazine papers with various paper thickness and slickness,  news paper cut-off with various sizes, receipts with various sizes and various paper thickness, ...etc. To my surprise, I have not run into any paper jam. Also, the paper feeding wheel never double feeds paper (two pages a time) into the scanner.The paper feeding tray can hold 250 pages of documents.That, indeed, does save me quite some work when archiving a big load of documents.Besides the rotary scanner for fast scanning, i2900 also has an additional flatbed scanner for scanning books. The flatbed scanner is very similar to other consumer level flatbed scanner. It scans slow. Not a big deal, as the flatbed scanner is mainly for occasional usage.When not used for a certain time (per user\\'s configuration), i2900 goes into energy saving mode. After being in energy saving mode for a certain time (per user\\'s configuration), it shuts itself off. Both the wake-up time (from the energy saving mode) and power-up time are fast.The provided Smart Touch software is able to control all i2900 scanner functions. So, there is no need to push any button on the scanner. I can also use my PaperPort pro to control the i2900.The package comes with an additional Kodak Capture Desktop software. This software is mainly for setting up batch jobs used by office admin or operators. In office environment, people just need to select the batch job type, then a stack of documents are scanned, indexed, and saved into a pre-defined file type. A video tutorial CD is provided in the package for training how to setup various batch job types.After more than 10 years of experience with the slow consumer level scanners, I am very impressed by the scanning speed and the scanning quality of i2900. This is a very good scanner for small office, or for people with big scanning needs at home.'"
