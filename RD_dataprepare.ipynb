              "'For those that haven\\'t finished Mass Effect 3, the first part of my review will be spoiler free, but the second part must be rife with spoilers because the story and ending is the biggest problem of the game. I\\'ll also preface this review by saying that the ME series had been probably my favorite gaming series of all times, and I beat the campaign of ME1 three times while I finished the campaign of ME2 four times. I had been incredibly excited about the game, and had been able to avoid practically every spoiler except for two smaller ones about EDI and the Prothean character. Even though the game is flawed, I loved pretty much 99% of the game, but the ending was so bad that it has ruined my entire Mass Effect experience. I was going to play the game again with my female character as I loved the voice over work of Jennifer Hale, but now I don\\'t really want to. I was even going to start a new character in ME1 and play all three games in succession, but now it just isn\\'t worth it.So, let\\'s start with the gameplay, which in the Mass Effect series is split between the RPG aspects, and the third person cover shooting battle system. ME3 definitely has the best action gameplay of the entire series, and while it can still be clunky there are constantly amazing moments with dozens of different but equally awesome strategies you could employ. I just wish there were almost more buttons on the controller for this game. It\\'s one of the most effective uses of a controller in any shooter, where you really have so many different attacks you could use at every moment. Most of the clunkiness once again resolves around the action button being the same as the sprint and cover button. I\\'m not sure if it would work, but it could be interesting if the action button was instead mapped to the select button, the only one that isn\\'t used in the game.Now on to the RPG systems of the game, which is much improved from basic systems in ME2, for Mass Effect 3 they basically took most of what was in ME1 and stripped out the hassle of the massive inventory screen and the repetitive/annoying/time-consuming aspect of destroying/selling the multitude of useless items you received. This interesting new inventory management system works by all of the weapons having a weight, and if you go over a certain weight limit (which is dependent on your character class and certain upgrades you can choose) you can face severe power regeneration penalties. I love this idea, but it can become annoying when all of the good weapons have really high weight. It also ends up limiting the weapons you can bring along, even though I was a Vanguard that selected the increase weight capacity upgrade. There\\'s a possible related result, where you can no longer carry any heavy weapons like in previous games, something that I always loved. Instead there are only four heavy weapons found at few certain points lying on the ground (flamethrower, rocket launcher, some Geth laser gun, and the mini-nuke) with very limited ammo. Back to the main weapons that are in this game, I loved that Bioware brought back the Role Playing elements present in ME1 guns, almost keeping the same names and level presentation. The concept is really smart, where you can purchase an upgrade up to level 5 for each weapon and each weapon add-on (that you can have two equipped on each gun). The only problems here is that I had enough money so that each time I got a new gun I promptly maxed out the upgrades, so the system wasn\\'t as rewarding as it could have been. Also, with the level of each add-on upgrading when you find or buy a new one, while I love this, it was a little uneven where multiple times I upgraded ones I didn\\'t use while I couldn\\'t find the upgrades for the ones I did regularly use. This whole system could be improved with a few adjustments, which is possibly a higher level cut-off limit like in Multiplayer (could make it so that weapons that you like don\\'t become useless because of their stats later in the game) and something that I liked in the first game but disappeared in the sequels. That is a weapon efficiency upgrade system where you could get experience points for every enemy you kill with each weapon type, I think this could really increase the RPG feel while keeping all of the action. One more thing with the weapons, there\\'s an interesting section of the Spectre offices where you have a fire range to test your weapon load-out. I love this idea, especially with all of the different weapons, but it makes no sense to have it on the Citadel, instead it should be in the Normandy Cargo Bay. Too many times I would upgrade a new weapon only to find I didn\\'t like the way it fired. Then there are weapons that I never tried out as their weight was really high and the stats weren\\'t the best. So while I may have possibly liked the way they fired, now I\\'ll never know as I didn\\'t have an opportunity to test them out.I was pretty disappointed that no real changes (non-cosmetic) were made to the armor system. It\\'s much too basic, almost exactly the same as ME2, and I wish there were more options to alter and upgrade your armor. I really kept the same armor for most of the game, even later I just made a few adjustments and all I cared about was getting the bonus percentages I wanted. The armor also looked all pretty similar, except for the helmets, which were mostly pretty goofy looking. Finally, for the different character classes, in this iteration they seem about the same, but some new abilities have been added. One of them that I really loved was the new Nova attack which was really useful when combined with the Biotic Charge, also I like that it\\'s not perfect as it uses up your shields, creating an interesting cost versus benefit play choice.The next aspect of the game is one that has really defined to series up to this point, and that is the conversation system of ME3. I was very disappointed that the conversation options were much more limited in this iteration, where you basically only had the paragon or renegade choice. There was never a paragade response or something else like the sarcastic comments I loved making in Dragon Age 2, at this point in the series it felt like a step back. There was also an annoying amount of conversations that resembled your talks with the DLC characters Massani and Goto. I didn\\'t mind this too much, but it was frustrating when multiple times I would accidently hit the A button one too many times and I would skip the conversation. I also had a few graphics glitches during the normal conversations with choices, where the character\\'s framework was broken or glitched, and they\\'d be looking all over the place or the eyes would be tracking wrong, it was just really weird. Even stranger, this tended to happen earlier in the game (they either occurred with Liara or Ravik), I didn\\'t really experience it too much later, I\\'m not sure why. Possibly relating to this, I didn\\'t have any problems importing my character\\'s face as some have, but I think that\\'s because I played around with it in ME2 because I didn\\'t love my Shepard\\'s face.There were multiple times in conversations where there were great little inside joke comments that were only for my Shepard, but I was a little disappointed that there weren\\'t more new in depth conversations with your crew. Even with the new character Vega, while I love the sparring match/conversation you had with him (One of my favorite crew member interactions in the whole series) you don\\'t get to know him as much as you did the previous game\\'s characters. I understand that with the possibility of almost every old character not being present in ME3, the developer didn\\'t want to spend too much time and money on them, but conversely they didn\\'t add many new characters. In total, not counting the DLC character, there are only four new crew members on the Normandy (all of whom are humans): the new playable jock character, a gay male pilot, a gay female communications officer, and a female reporter. I liked all of these new characters (though the reporter is a little generic and annoying) but consider something for a minute. If Garrus and Tali had died in your playthrough of ME2, for most of the game you would only have two playable characters, Vega and Liara. Later of course, you get Kaidan/Ashley and EDI, but it\\'s amazing they didn\\'t add new characters or make more of the characters from ME2 crew members. Even with all of the crew members possible, you don\\'t get a representative from the Krogans and the Salarians, or any of the other non-council races. I expected to see all of the different species send someone onto the Normandy, but for some reason no one did. All we got was a Krogan leader (Wrex!), a Turian leader, and a Quarian leader in the War Room for a few missions. You\\'d think that if Bioware didn\\'t want to waste time and money on possibly unpopular characters, they would have created more characters that every player would get to know. The only possible explanation for why they didn\\'t do this is that they didn\\'t think they had the time to establish multiple new interesting characters.Another annoying change to something I loved before, was how when you\\'re in the hub-world listening to people\\'s interesting conversations you have to leave the area and come back to hear the next part of the story. In ME2, you could just keep hitting the A button to listen to the rest of the conversation, which to me worked really well. This time, even though the stories are cool, I would lose interest in them as so much time could pass between each part of the telling, also at one point they glitched out and all of the conversations reset. I also had a problem that I figure has to be a glitch where at the last conversation with the Illusive Man, the Paragon and Renegade options were greyed out. With this Shepard I have always selected the blue conversation options in each Mass Effect game every time they appeared, and I also always explore every possible conversation option. I had off the charts amounts of Reputation and Paragon points and still I had a conversation option blocked, the first time this has ever happened to me (in the Mass Effect series and every other video game with a similar conversation system). I felt extremely confused and annoyed that somehow the best possible resolution to the Illusive Man conflict wasn\\'t available to me for no apparent reason.Onto the locations and exploration of the different worlds, something that was one of my favorite parts of the previous games, but is almost non-existent in ME3. Here is where ME3 strikingly reminds me of the failure of Dragon Age 2. Similarly to Kirkwall, the Citadel acts as the only hub-world in the entire Mass Effect 3 game, while in ME2 there were four completely different hub-worlds. This would be okay, as most worlds are under attack from the Reapers, except for the fact that this version of the Citadel is the smallest and most basic of the entire Mass Effect trilogy. Then the Citadel only goes through a very minor cosmetic change halfway through the game, and they expect us, a society full of ADHD people, not to grow bored of the surroundings. We get to go to worlds we\\'ve always wanted to explore, like the Turian, Salarian, Quarian, Asari and Human home-worlds, but all of them are filled with waist high walls and they\\'re all being blown up by Reapers and/or attacked by Cerberus. The missions are also relatively short, and we fail to really see anything unique about the planets. Further, ME3 has essentially eliminated the mini missions on random worlds, and the probe mechanic found in ME2. Instead, now you have to fly around each system evading the Reapers while you randomly scan for 2 or 3 of the interesting things, which are either small amounts of fuel or some random unexplained war asset on a planet. Then you get to play a few basic solo N7 missions on the limited number of Multiplayer maps. I understand that exploring Alien worlds isn\\'t a priority in the middle of a war with a group of ancient synthetic/organic hybrid monster spaceships, but I missed this aspect that was hugely present in the previous games.Related to the locations and explorations, I\\'m going to talk a little bit about the further development of the alien species you encounter. Sadly, we see very little new aspects of the previously introduced alien species, and no new aliens. One thing we do see is our first Krogan female, who is a very cool character, though the time spent with her is short. Also, you don\\'t see too much of the Krogan woman, but this kind of makes sense when you consider the Krogan society. Once again, every other species\\' females are non-existent, I guess Bioware believes the Asari provide enough females for everyone. Also, I can explain away why we don\\'t see many of the other races\\' females (though we probably should see them as refugees or scientists), but I find it weird that we don\\'t see any Turian females. From Garrus\\' previous stories, it has been established that females can serve in their military and can compete with the best of the males (also they\\'re apparently very flexible but don\\'t have much reach). The one new design that Bioware were extremely successful in creating was that of the Prothean. They succeeded in looking like the Collectors and were just extremely cool. I loved even more the reality of what their culture was in comparison to what everyone had believed. The only problem is that for some reason Bioware decided to make this important and awesome character first-day DLC.  Finally, the worst aspects of the new alien design in ME3 are the Quarians.I either wanted Bioware to keep the Quarians faces secret, or I wanted a beautiful scene to show off Tali\\'s true face, they even had the perfect situation when they are on her home planet of Rannoch. Instead Bioware was lazy, and they just had Tali give a picture to Shepard that he could keep in his cabin. This picture showed a poorly photo-shopped stock photo of a cute human woman that probably took an hour or two to make. Every single piece of Tali fan art I\\'ve seen is a hundred times better than what Bioware chose. Since Turians and Quarians are so closely related (same amino acid structure) then they would probably look more similar to each other instead of being human (except for some tattoos and different hands). Of course, they would be also be different in many ways (the Turian world experienced a lot of radiation which caused them to develop the armor plates) and there was something about the Quarians where they have a symbiosis with the plant life on their world, and because of this their immune systems weren\\'t fully developed (this was then made worse by years and years spent on sterile space ships). Even if Bioware wanted a mostly human design to appease Tali fans (which there is some precedent for as the eyes and nose appear human behind the mask) I\\'ve seen much better humanoid designs for Tali. I mean it\\'s a little strange where fans are more talented and spend more time creating images of a very important design than the official developer.Here\\'s where I\\'m going to stick a bunch of the random features in the game. I was a bit surprised by the complete elimination of mini-games in ME3, while they were all a little annoying before, instead of fixing them now they just removed them, and the doors/safes take a little longer to open, implying that you\\'re automatically performing some type of hack or bypass. The reputation system is a much appreciated addition/adaptation, where you get standard reputation points for performing moral neutral actions, and every Paragon or Renegade point adds to your total. Because of this, players are no longer punished from not being an absolute character, and no matter you preference if you have enough reputation points both of the Paragon and Renegade conversation choices are unlocked. However, it is pretty goofy how the bar is filled up very early into the game, I was still getting lots of points, but there was no visual interpretation of the increase. I almost wish there was a bigger bar, or even a numerical presentation of all of your reputation points. Another new addition to this game is the War Assets and Effective Military Strength (EMS). I really liked this feature, as everything you\\'ve done in the Mass Effect series is represented here. However, once again the bar fills up incredibly early in the game. There\\'s also some really disturbing about the EMS, and that\\'s the aspect of Galactic Readiness, which can only be increased by playing multiplayer. So if you hate Co-op Multiplayer, or if you don\\'t have enough money or the ability to have an Xbox Live Gold Membership, your Galactic Readiness is locked at 50%. This means that all of your War Assets will be halved for the EMF. So let\\'s look at my level, I had 7245 points with a Galactic Readiness hovering around 100%. If I wouldn\\'t have played Multiplayer, then I would have only had 3622 EMF points, which is enough to get the endings but is not enough to get the \"best\" ending. To put this in perspective, I played every mission available except for a few that glitched out on me. The only things that might have lowered my war assets, were that in ME1 I saved the Council, in ME2 I destroyed the Collector Base (even though for the story Cerberus still found most of it intact), and in ME3 I cured the Krogan Genophage which annoyed the Salarians. One other random thing, in ME3 you don\\'t have someone like Kelly that will take care of your fish. The only option is to buy a crazy expensive Aquarium VI, and if you don\\'t your fish will die, even if you feed them every chance you get. You\\'d think EDI would be able to monitor your fish tank for free, but I guess it\\'d be a little degrading considering her new role as a crew member on herself.Now onto the last aspect of the game that isn\\'t the story, and that is the newly added Co-op Multiplayer. I was initially concerned about this aspect of the game, but I\\'ve had a lot of fun playing with it. I did have a lot of problems with the EA servers the first couple of days though, and this was exasperated by the fact that you only get experience and credits by either successfully completing the mission, or by dying. I wish that the game would save your experience after each wave, especially when any expendable items you use before you disconnect are lost forever. After this I also glitched out a couple times, once I got stuck in a wall, but I was actually still able to kill a bunch of the enemies while some of them were unable to get me. Another time I glitched out during multiplayer, it was much worse and much weirder, where the whole stage was shaking like I was in the middle of an earthquake. Then while I was running, I ended up floating in the air for a few feet before falling through the floor (I actually have a video of it but it\\'s kind of crappy since I couldn\\'t find my camera and used my iPod). Sadly or thankfully, my team members were a capable bunch (even though it was a silver Reaper mission) and were able to beat the 10 waves, though it took like 20 minutes where I just had to float there in nothingness and wait. The even weirder thing was that I could damage some of the enemies with biotic powers, and the enemies were able to kill me. However, once I died I would immediately come back to life. Looking past the glitches, I love leveling up the different characters, and with a group of capable players the missions can be very fun. However, after a while I grew a little bored playing the missions, they\\'re all just too similar. Then I worked really hard on maxing out the Vanguard branch, but when I hit level 20, to get the achievement I promoted the soldiers. This is a cool idea, but I wish there was more of a reward for this, or possibly the ability to still use the high level characters when attempting a Gold level mission, or at the very least a new character plus where they get an extra bonus so you\\'re not starting from the very beginning of the character. The biggest problem I have with the multiplayer though is that EA decided to for the first time in a AAA console game to include a freemium pricing structure for the locked characters, weapons and items. I actually find this kind of offensive, as I could play the multiplayer for hours and get a random pack someone else could get immediately by shilling out two dollars. I especially have a problem with this pricing as you could spend two dollars on a pack, and get nothing you could use. If you\\'re going to charge for items others could get by just playing the game, I think you should be able to pick items, although of course it would make it even more unfair for people that don\\'t want to be tricked into paying for items that are already in the game. I think that the Multiplayer could be saved with a patch, and possibly more game modes than the 10 waves that always feature the play modes capture the flag, secure the base, head-hunt certain enemies, and kill everything moving. As it currently stands, I can\\'t see this multiplayer establishing a consistent faithful base for anything nearing long term.Now, I can finally get to the aspect of the game that had me the most upset/frustrated, and that is the story. From here on in, warning, there be major spoilers ahead. Right from the start of the game the story is goofy. A minute after our first look at the ME universe\\'s Earth, the Reapers attack, not giving the player any time to acclimate to the game. Then a little later (after a goofy child\\'s death that will haunt Shepard for the rest of the game) you are introduced to the game\\'s one and only plot device, blueprints for an all-powerful weapon designed but not completed by the Protheans, called the Crucible. This is just so generic and out of the blue, it doesn\\'t make any sense, but I was ok with playing along. You then have a mission involving each of the previous ME game\\'s characters, some small and some large. The developers then proceed to kill off two of my favorite characters in these missions, Mordin and Thane. However, I can accept their deaths, especially since it was established previously that both of them were near death (old age and lung disease respectively) and both of them were done very well, they had good deaths. I admit that I felt serious emotion with both of them, and I may or may not have cried through the whole hospital scene.I have a lot of problems with the development of Cerberus as the main antagonist in a game about the Reapers. I understand that Bioware wanted to provide different enemies to face, and I admit that their AI and designs are excellent. However, I don\\'t understand how Cerberus became so powerful. Every time you see them they\\'re a step ahead of you, even when you kill hundreds or thousands of their heavily armed and trained troops. Later they kind of explain this by establishing that they created a refugee Sanctuary that was actually a Human harvesting and indoctrination factory, but it still doesn\\'t quite add up. I didn\\'t love Cerberus in ME2, and things they\\'ve done had always been on the border of indecency and terrorism, but it usually seemed to be in Humanity\\'s best interest. However, in ME3 they\\'re all crazy and doing absolutely horrible incomprehensible things, Bioware tries to say it\\'s all because TIM has been slowly indoctrinated and he\\'s now under control of the Reapers, but I never really thought they successfully established this. Probably the goofiest Cerberus plot line is the coup of the Citadel, which made absolutely zero sense. They somehow gained control of Udina (who while being a douche bag didn\\'t have any connections to Cerberus and had no reason to betray the rest of the Council) and managed to infiltrate the Citadel which is supposed to be the safest and most guarded place in the Galaxy (they even again said they upgraded the security). Then they for some reason wanted to assassinate the entire council, for reasons that are never explained.Up until around halfway through the game, I didn\\'t love the story, but I was in love with the game and having a lot of fun playing it. I mean the actual story for ME2 was pretty basic and goofy, but I still absolutely loved the game. Then, after the previously mentioned Cerberus coup of the Citadel, I received the first realization that Bioware might not care about their fans, or that they might possibly even hate us. Previously in the Citadel, you met up and talked to Kelly Chambers in the refugee camp. There was a great little scene where after asking if she wants to rejoin the Normandy, she describes the horror she experienced on the Collector ship, and that she can\\'t be on the Normandy as it reminds her of what she faced. Instead, she\\'s helping the refugees coming into the Citadel. I loved this little interaction, and I thought it was great fan service for people that liked Kelly. Then after the coup, when walking around the refugee camp you hear two people talking and they basically say \"Have you seen that red headed woman who was helping out so much?\" \"You didn\\'t hear? A Cerberus soldier came up asking if she was Kelly Chambers, and after she said yes he just shot her in the head.\" \"Huh, I guess if Cerberus asks you if you\\'re someone, you should just say no.\" \"Hah hah hah.\"  This was a character I spent the whole of ME2 talking to and growing to care about, and Bioware decided to kill her off so disrespectfully and unnecessarily, I was just absolutely horrified. I wished I could have never heard that conversation, but no, it will now always be in my brain.After this point, everything was ok, not perfect but I pretty much enjoyed all of the events and there were some truly awesome kickass scenes (I loved the fight where you called on the mother of all Thresher Maws and the brokering of peace between the Quarians and Geth), until the final battle to retake Earth. The whole strategy for retaking Earth was a little goofy, but I didn\\'t mind it too much. There was also a great area where before the final battle you walk around the camp and talk to all of your party members, and you can even call and talk to the previous game\\'s characters that aren\\'t playable in ME3. The conversations are a little short, but I enjoyed all of them. Then after fighting for a while, you get to the beam to take you to the Citadel (Which was overtaken by the Reapers without any explanation of how & you can assume billions of people were killed) and everything breaks apart in a million pieces. You know the developer did something wrong when fan created explanations/interpretations make more sense than what we were actually given (The most logical being that the whole Citadel sequence was an indoctrinated dream). Other people have more succinctly examined and explained all of the different problems and plot holes, so I won\\'t go too in depth here. Nevertheless, you are apparently hit by the Reaper\\'s laser beam that destroys everything it touches, but here you only get some melted armor and a beat up face. You also receive a very powerful heavy pistol with unlimited ammo that you use to kill the Reaper creations between you and the teleportation beam. When you get to the beam and are transported to the Citadel, somehow both the Illusive Man and Anderson beat you to the main room. There\\'s this whole thing where somehow TIM is able to control your body and make you shoot Anderson, but you are able to break control and kill TIM.After ascending the elevator to the merged Crucible and Citadel console, a God-like AI in the form of the dead child from Earth appears. Here, Bioware for some reason decides to give you more questions instead of providing the player with any answers. The God-child says that the Reapers are his answer to the problem that Synthetic life (pure order) will eventually completely wipe out all Organic life (pure chaos). Basically, the Reapers were created to save Organic life from Synthetics by murdering and harvesting every developed race each 50,000 years (A synthetic being created hybrids to kill organics to save them from being killed by synthetics). Through this whole interaction, Shepard acts completely subjugated and accepts everything the child says as absolute truth. You are finally given three options, you can control the Reapers (presented as the blue or Paragon choice even though it was represented by TIM, who was at least a Renegade character), you could destroy the Reapers along with all synthetic life (presented as the red or Renegade choice even though it was represented by Anderson, who was absolutely a Paragon character), or you could take the third option which would merge all organic and synthetic life (presented by no one, but this is obviously the choice that the God-child AI wants). Then, no matter what choice you make, as long as your war assets are beyond a very small level, Shepard dies, the Reapers leave Earth or are destroyed, every Mass Relay is destroyed (hopefully in a way different than what was seen in the Arrival DLC or entire systems might have been wiped out of existence), and the Normandy (After Joker apparently flees the battle on Earth) just barely escapes the blast and crash lands on an Eden-like planet, with characters that were just with you rushing the beam somehow being magically transported to the Normandy.Then that\\'s it, the game is over except for a ridiculous conversation featuring a star-child and an old man taking place in a forest that resembles the one in Shepard\\'s dream (and a flash of Shepard taking a breath if you had enough EMS and chose to destroy the Reapers). Oh, also there\\'s an insulting message telling you to buy the future DLC Bioware releases, and you\\'re set up back on the Normandy before the raid on the Cerberus base. I literally walked all around the Normandy trying to talk to everyone, and it felt like I was in a different dimension, it was just so weird and awkward. The only real difference between the three endings is the color of the beam the Crucible emits and the explosion that follows. When faced with the choice, I watched each ending on Youtube, and decided on the Green/Synthesis ending. Partly because it was the weirdest, but mostly because Edi and Joker embrace in that end, and if I had to die & the universe had to be irreversibly changed (most likely leading to many of the stranded races on Earth dying of starvation and never seeing their homes or loved ones) at least someone could find some happiness in this ending.So why am I and almost every Mass Effect fan outraged at the ending\"s\" Bioware gave us? (In one poll found on the official Mass Effect forums 91% of around 60,000 fans hated the ending and wants Bioware to change it completely, and 6% still wanted the ending slightly adjusted). First and foremost, the ending is so bleak and depressing, that there is no opportunity for happiness or even a sense of accomplishment that should come with beating a video game. I\\'ve never before played a game that punished me for beating it. Then there are so many plot holes with weird and abrupt revelations that make no sense. However, the biggest problem with the ending is that no choice that you made in all three games has any bearing on the outcome. As long as your Shepard didn\\'t die in ME2 and you have the minimum amount of war assets or EMS in ME3 you get the same ending as someone that worked hard in each Mass Effect game and created their perfect Shepard story, maxing out all of the meters, doing all of the missions. I wouldn\\'t have liked any ending where Shepard dies, but I could have accepted it if it was well done and provided closure, instead of just appearing to be the crumpled pieces of paper that a writer with any talent would have thrown into the trash.The prevailing sense of hopelessness despair and depression was never before found in the Mass Effect games. Even though you faced suicide missions, if you did everything right only one of your team members died in the games, and the overall mission was always essentially a complete success (There were always a large amount of casualties, but they were all blank faces). I really can\\'t see how anyone at Bioware would have liked this ending. I\\'ve come to the conclusion that either Bioware doesn\\'t care about their long term fans, hates their long term fans, or are so stupid that they thought the fans would actually like the ending they provided (or possibly a fourth option where they\\'re just being trolls and the whole ending was a dream sequence and the true ending is being released as DLC, although I would probably associate this option as aligning closely to \"they don\\'t care about'"

The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent \\'prayer of the bone\" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don\\'t get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It\\'s just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.  Lets hope this show continues on for many years to come.']\n",
            " ['I discovered this series quite by accident. Having watched and appreciated Masterpiece Contemporary: Place of Execution, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written, and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the \"cozy\" mysteries such as the long-running Midsomer Murders - Set One and The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, sometimes involving children, almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.The first season contains three main stories, each divided into two episodes:The Mermaids Singing - Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.Shadows Rising - The skeletal remains of a young woman is found, and when further evidence turns up, DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands, one with a penchant for dark-haired young women.Justice Painted Blind - Another unsettling case, this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. This throws up a whole bunch of suspects, including the parents of the murdered girl.The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.The streaming was good overall with only a little delayed streaming during Episode One. There were no glitches on the other episodes. The picture quality could be improved though as it did seem a bit grainy to me.']\n",

You need an affinity for quirky, offbeat humor to enjoy it, not to mention a high tolerance for raw language and sexual humor.  The first season consisted of just seven episodes, but established the core characters and operators of Paddy&#8217;s Pub; owners Dennis, Mac, and Charlie, and waitress/Dennis&#8217;s twin sister Dee.  In Season 2 (ten episodes), Danny Devito comes on board as Frank, Dennis and Dee&#8217;s dad.  The show&#8217;s creators (Rob McElhenney/ Mac; Glenn Howerton/Dennis; and Charlie Day/Charlie) are hilarious as actors, and also as writers.  Every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me.  It&#8217;s one of those great ensemble casts that&#8217;s incredibly balanced in terms of the personalities and comedic nature of each character, resulting in a consistently high level of quality in every episode.  These first two seasons have some of my favorites, including &#8220;Charlie Has Cancer,&#8221; &#8220;Charlie Got Molested,&#8221; &#8220;Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,&#8221; &#8220;Hundred Dollar Baby,&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody&#8217;s Ass.&#8221;  Like most fans of the show, I tend to favor the Charlie-themed episodes, and considering that he&#8217;s the only one so far to get movie roles and a gig hosting SNL, it&#8217;s clear how important he is as part of the cast.  But that&#8217;s not a knock against anyone else.  I can&#8217;t really imagine it continuing if they lost any of the key characters of Dennis, Dee, Mac, and Charlie, and even though Frank wasn't there in the beginning, it would definitley hurt the show to lose him.

At things that aren't supposed to be funny, but as any serious fan of comedy knows, those can be the best laughs. I walked away feeling lighter and happier. If that ain't comedic success, what is?IASIP is like Seinfeld if the SeinFour were ten years younger, Irish, and ran a bar in South Philly. These guys have clearly studied Sein and Curb very closely, and their tight timing and topics and banter are all very Larry Davidesque...but they go places even LD won't. The best two shows of the 7-episode first season are about cancer and abortion; I howled at some moments. These guys have done what so many guys want to do: make a show about how funny they are. Except, these guys really are funny. Sometimes. But hey, no one's always hittin' homers, even on comedy 'roids, so I cut these three some slack and marvel at how tightly they work together. There's a lot to be said for working with old friends, if they have talent: the camaraderie and timing here are born of many years of drinking and laughing and thinking and falling down, no doubt. And these three guys are each pretty dang funny, each in his own fashion.DeVito is ok but I liked the first season best for its rawness. Still, as the later shows get a little more polished it's often in good ways.If you don't like drinking, if you insist on PC language from your friends and neighbors, and if you are in general just plain uptight about people living and thinking the way you want them to, look elsewhere. But If you enjoy tying one on and laughing your butt off at the endlessly silly idiocy that accompanies being alive in America these days, you may just find Always Sunny to be almost always funny.\"]\n",

You'd think the premise (every hour of the 24 episode-long season is played in real-time; thus 24 encapsulates a full day) would get old by now, but, surprisingly, the producers and writers have managed to come up with another riveting, must-see season. In fact, this might be the best season of them all. The thrills and nail-biting suspense (as well as the SPOILERS alert) begin early in the season five opener, with the shocking slaying of President Palmer and assassination attempts on familiar CTU agents (one of which is tragically successful). Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is lured out of hiding after 18 months and becomes rapidly embroiled in a devious conspiracy that goes all the way up to the White House. As he becomes the most wanted man in America (he is framed for Palmer's assassination), he must try to ferret out the true culprit(s) and again save the country from deadly Russian extremists and various domestic villains. On a personal level, he must come to terms with the deaths of personal friends, the alienation of his daughter Kim, and the fact that his former girlfriend  Audrey Raines (Kim Raver) might have moved on.There's a reason why Kiefer won the best dramatic actor Emmy and why 24 beat out the likes of the West Wing, the Sopranos, Grey's Anatomy, and House for best drama. The fifth season is fully serviced by a coming together of story and acting - from the gripping, edge-of-your-seat plot line, with its manic twists and turns, to the no-quarters-given, full speed ahead performances of the cast, but specially of Kiefer Sutherland, who gives his all in inhabiting his role. Kiefer IS the show and consistently produces such driven intensity, lying just beneath an icy cold surface, and yet his eyes reveal a vulnerability of sorts, when he's reacting to something personal to him. He makes a scene work, even without dialogue. Very good stuff. And, no, you do not want to get in the way of Jack Bauer.There are other standouts, of course. Gregory Itzin as the shifty and weak-willed U.S. President makes you gleefully hiss, while Jean Smart as the medicated First Lady Martha Logan brings earnest soap-opera acting to primetime. Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe O'Brian) continues her highlight role as CTU's brilliant but cantankerous and socially-inept tech support operative. Meanwhile, James Morrison, Roger Cross, Kim Raver, Carlos Bernard, Louis Lombardi, and Sean Astin become the season's dependable, solid bedrock.That so many of the regular cast die in this season lends an immediacy to the episodes and exponentially raises the stakes. There's no comfort level at all here, as you're never sure who would survive in the end (but, with this show, were you ever sure?). Even Kiefer Sutherland had played around with the idea of having Jack Bauer biting the dust (Please, no!).So, the 24 - Season Five dvd box releases December 5, 2006, just in time for you to go thru 'em to prep for season six, which begins next January on Fox. Season Six, by the way, picks up nearly two years after season five's finale and will have James Cromwell with a recurring role as Jack's estranged dad, Phillip Bauer. Also joining the cast is Eddie Izzard, Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle), Peter MacNicol, Regina King, and the beautiful Rena Sofer. I can't wait to own season five and, then, to see season six. Long live Jack Bauer!\"]\n",
            " ['Revel in his awesomeness!!! For he is a god amongst men and he is deserving of all praise that can possibly be heaped upon him. The one time the Emmys got something right!! Jack Bauer is as close as any fictional character has become to being superhumanly powerful, and at some times his recurrent circumvention of the bureaucratic system, assaulting his friends and co-workers, his flagrant abuse of \"prisoner\\'s rights\" and his uncanny ability to fight his way out of any trap... it may require a little bit more suspension of disbelief than would normally be necessary in a lesser show, but the very core of this show is Jack Bauer, or more specifially, Kiefer Sutherland and his increasingly better performance each season of 24. When he is having a particularly emotional moment, you feel it exude from the screen.... this is just an example of the power that Sutherland brings to this show. Also standing out as always is Mary Lynn Rasjkub as the wonderfully ascerbic and wicked-tongued Chloe O\\'Brien. The introduction of her character is one of the best things that\\'s happened to this show. But this season has some other stand-out characters: one that was introduced in season 4 and a brand new one. Fans of the show know these as President Charles Logan (the wonderfully slimy Gregory Itzin) and his first lady Martha Logan (the amazing Jean Smart). Their interplay and their performances are almost as key as Sutherland in this season. Another thing that came to be almost an in-joke is that three members of the cast of the original ROBOCOP film appear in different parts of the series, which as a fan of that film was just really cool to see. Whether or not that was intended, it\\'s still a nice touch for genre fans. Julian Sands has lots of fun chewing up scenery as the evil Russian-yet-English-Accented Terrorist. The premise is per usual: Jack must defy all odds to save the country and avenge his personal losses. But the plot itself is of a higher level of complexity and tragedy this season than prior seasons. The way it begins is ALMOST as shocking as the way the season ends. And the ending of the final episode of the season... that scream you heard in the whole of the United States and parts of Canada and Mexico... that was me. January 2007 CANNOT GET HERE SOON ENOUGH!!!']\n",

Several of lead character Jack Bauer's friends are killed or attacked and he's out to find out who and get revenge. Ok, sometimes the overall story arch DOES get side-tracked to the typical (terrorists trying to release poisonous gas), and sometimes it's not always that interesting (CTU gets infiltrated AGAIN!). But none of these side-attractions even BEGIN to take-away from the exciting central story which pushes along at break-neck speed and crediblilty (thanks also to the believable performances of the ENTIRE cast).Like some people I try not to watch the show on TV and much prefer to wait for the DVD to come out which is why I can't recommend buying this season enough (thought why there's not subtitles on every episode is beyond me). Yes it's a couple years old now, but it's still the best (and most affordable) 24 episodes of action you'll find anywhere.\"]\n",

Even after five years, this show is gripping drama with excellent writing and acting.  I am glued to my seat every week, breathing only during commercial breaks.  This season the threat and storytelling seemed more focused then previous years, adding to the drama.There were a couple flaws this season.  I sure don't remember the explanation of who knew Jack was alive at the beginning of the season.  Maybe it was mentioned and I missed it.  Furthermore, we have yet more examples of lack of security at CTU.  While it does make for gripping drama, it does seem like they could come up with a new plot trick every so often.My biggest complaint this season was the body count.  We lost several key characters from previous years.  While I understand the producer's desire to keep us on the edge of our seats, can't anyone from the show live happily ever after?  It honestly got to the point I dreaded seeing anyone who had been on the show before for fear they would be killed off.Still, these are minor issues with a truly wonderful show.

It starts strong and doesn\\'t let up until it\\'s over.As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. Season 5, however, breaks from this tradition and instead packages the discs in 4 slim cases (the 4th holds the bonus features disc). A change of page in packaging, but still quite attractive, with approximately the same shelf footprint (if not slightly smaller).Season 5 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and bonus features. I might note however, they\\'ve added a slightly longer intro before getting to the main menu (looks like booting up and logging into a CTU computer system). However, on my DVD player I could skip ahead without having to play the whole sequence. So, it wasn\\'t completely ungainly.The video and audio were up to par. Of course I don\\'t have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can\\'t test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn\\'t notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I\\'ve noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn\\'t say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn\\'t seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you\\'ll probably like 24 as well. There are some \"intense\" scenes and probably some harsh language, so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters, if at all.']\n",

The fifth season of \"24\" revolves around one central mystery: who killed an ex-president and how is Jack Bauer connected to the assassination? It\\'s a thrilling season--probably the best since the first season--and it comes to a stunning conclusion that will be answered in January of 2007. Interestingly after having watched \"Casino Royale\" its clear that the new Bond film was inspired by shows like \"24\" which were, in turn, inspired by early Bond and some of the newer spy thrillers out there. There are a number of twists and turns in this season set my advice is NOT to read any reviews that summarize anymore of the plot if you haven\\'t seen this season as there are some major spoilers in some of the reviews that follow.As usual Fox has put together a terrific DVD. This also features a brief episode \"prequel\" to the sixth season like previous sets had. We get a large amount of worthwhile commentary tracks including some with Emmy winner Kiefer Sutherland. There\\'s also a summary of the season included as well athough if you\\'ve watched the show (or are watching it now) it won\\'t really provide anything new. Th \"100 Episode Reel\" is a pretty useless extra -- basically a clips compilation.Different places are offering different exclusives. If you purchase it here you can download a free episode from Unbox (at least during the Holidays) while Target also offers a limited edition bonus disc for this set with additional featurettes on the show. Regardless of whether you buy it here at amazon.com or elsewhere this set features plenty of extras including an examination of the wonderful Presidential retreat featured in the show, a good featurette on the stellar work by the cinematography on the show, a featurette on the supporting actors on the show as well as extended and deleted scenes. I haven\\'t had a chance to dig through all the bonus material yet but it what I have checked out looks really, really good.This set is packaged in the thinpak holders with two discs per holder so the accordian style packaging has been abandoned for this thinner packaging.

            " ['While Season One of 24 focused much of its attention on President David Palmer, Seasons 2-4 saw the Oval Office by and large take a back seat to the missions of Jack Bauer and CTU.  However, Season Five brings some of the attention back to the sitting U.S. President (this time Charles Logan) and ends up with a much more well-rounded storyline.For a basic (non-spoilery) plot summary, a group of Russian terrorists threaten to release canisters of nerve gas in the U.S., leading Bauer to be reprieved from his thought-to-be death in order to help stop the crisis.  As CTU begins investigating the terrorism, however, it quickly becomes clear that the terrorists are working with a high-ranking government official, and the conspiracy begins to be unraveled.To be honest, at first I was skeptical of all the focus on President Logan, as didn\\'t like his character and wasn\\'t sure that he could command the camera as well as his predecessor Palmer.  However, by the end of the season, Logan is easily the most enjoyable/interesting character on the show.  His acting, along with his wife, chief of staff, and head of security, really gives the show the Presidential presence it lacked since that first season.Of course, there is still more than enough of Jack Bauer and his fellow CTU agents (Audrey Rains, Bill Buchanon, Edgar Stiles, Chloe O\\'Brien, etc.) to go around, which means that intense drama ensues in every single episode.  The writers have an amazing way to take a character that looks like a creep (think Tony Almeida and George Mason in the early seasons) and, by the end of a few episodes, have him become a noble hero, and that tradition continues in this season as well.The only \"knock\" I have on this season is that the cliffhanger endings of each episodes aren\\'t quite as shocking (e.g. Nina Myers doesn\\'t appear out of nowhere).  However, I think that was more of a creative choice by the writers, as the story is actually more coherent that any season besides the first one.  Instead of seemingly changing the plot of the show with every episode, Season Five slowly crescendos until the big finale.So, fans of 24 can purchase this season with confidence knowing that they will still get their action, drama, suspense, and some great twists and turns along the way.']\n",

So, starting Season 3 off by showing Kate\\'s murder from Ari\\'s POV is a little rougher.  But the two episodes that start off Season 3 of NCIS--the two part \"Kill Ari\" episodes--really bring up a subject in this series that hadn\\'t been fully fleshed out.  Obviously, these two episodes allow the regular characters to come to grips with the loss of Kate--the irony of Kate\\'s ghost talking to Ducky and Ducky not talking back to the ghost, the overall story of how the survivors all see Kate.  McGee seeing a superwoman, Abby seeing Elvira, Tony being Tony in seeing Kate (That schoolgirl outfit), and Gibbs seeing Kate as he last saw her--with a hole between her eyes.  Just as obviously, \"Kill Ari\" allows for the introduction of Cote De Pablo\\'s Ziva David, the Mossad/Masada agent liased to NCIS in the wake of Kate\\'s death and Lauren Holly\\'s Jenny Sheppard--Gibbs\\' former partner/lover who rose beyond working the field to the NCIS director\\'s job.But my observation after a couple of viewings of this box set is that the underlying story of the season is the revelations about the history of Leroy Jethro Gibbs.  For much of the first two seasons, Mark Harmon\\'s \"tough, no-nonsense investigator\" (To quote the liner notes on the set) has always had an understated sense of humor that has allowed him to smile quitely at the office interaction between the members of the team while presenting his harder face.  But that exterior begins to crack in the \"Kill Ari\" episodes; the mystery surrounding Jethro\\'s background begins to unfold as Ari murders Kate, then takes his shot at Abby and captures Dr. Mallard.  This is what starts leading Jethro to being close to Ziva--maybe no one notices, but because of the information that she uncovered about Jethro and fed to her half-brother Ari, Officer David feels partially responsible for Kate\\'s murder.Through Season 3, we start getting clues to who Jethro is and what he keeps from everyone--the flask that we see at the end of \"Under Covers\", his continued attraction towards redheads (It certainly is no coincidence that Holly/Sheppard is a redhead), and the subtleties of his relationship with Ziva--forged in an oddly shared tragedy.  Of course, much of all that goes on in the season comes to a head in the \"Hiatus\" two-parter at the end of the season.  We find out why Gibbs is what he is, how many of his actions have prepared DiNozzo for running the team and prepped Tim for being an agent; and how the discoveries affect his relationship with Dr. Mallard and Director Sheppard.As always since this series started, the performances are stunning.  Mark Harmon continues to embody the toughness and instincts of Jethro, but also had to be very nuanced as Gibbs\\' painful history comes out.Michael Weatherly\\'s Tony DiNozzo continued being the second coming of David Addison (my usual Moonlighting aside), but Tony had to face growing up and being a decision-maker/leader (\"Bait\"), and had a difficulty through this season that he hadn\\'t had in the previous two--ZIVA.Cote De Pablo flipped the dynamic of the team.  As Ziva, Cote brought a much more formidable presence to the squad.  In the first two seasons, Tony could get Kate off-balance with his remarks and his stunts, offending her Catholic schoolgirl sensibilities.  In the third season, Ziva--partially because of her background, partially because it was just HER--was able to get Tony off his feed more than he thought possible.  An example of this--aside from her driving, or her mangling of slang--came up in \"Probie\", when she was able to get Tony to reveal why he was receiving calls from a sperm bank.  De Pablo was able to affect a very cool and very canny customer in Ziva.  Many viewers are always going to miss Sasha Alexander, but Cote is a wonderful fit.Sean Murray\\'s Tim McGee is still a wonderful work in progress; the nerd-boy field agent who continues to get tortured by DiNozzo in a big-brother/little-brother fashion.  He still seems over his head at times, eager to please Gibbs (Or at least keep Jethro from popping him one in the back of the head--isn\\'t it funny how The Head Slap has become one of the show\\'s many trademarks?).  Plus, there\\'s whatever seems to be going on in his private life, whether or not it\\'s with Abby.Of course, what can be said about Pauley?  Perrette is a scene-stealing wonder on screen, especially in Abby\\'s lab when she\\'s mainlining the \"Kaff-Pow\" or getting Bert to do what he does (Her stuffed hippo--YEAH, THAT ONE).  Plus, we get surprised by Abby\\'s ability with duct tape (\"Frame Up\") and her temper in general (\"Bloodbath\").David McCallum\\'s Dr. Mallard continues to be the second coming of Jonathan Quayle Higgins, though not as prissy as Robin Masters\\' major domo.  Ducky continues to tell his stories while working his was through the cadavers.  Plus, we get another visit from Nina Foch as Ducky\\'s mom late in the season, getting a surreal moment when she\\'s visiting the NCIS HQ.Many people thought the introduction of Jenny Sheppard as fluff.  Given the underlying story of the season, Lauren Holly\\'s character was actually needed.  Jenny became an insight to Gibbs\\' relationship issues and why he stays operating as an investigator--basically, she knows certain things about Jethro that his squad aren\\'t privvy to--though as it turns out, she doesn\\'t know the whole story (Until \"Hiatus\").The good guest shots in this set have to start with Sasha Alexander, and her completion of the Catlin Todd storyline.  Her ghost appearing in various forms to the team members was striking (Of course, her schoolgirl outfit in Tony\\'s vision was typical Tony).  Rudolf Martin\\'s Ari Haswari was brilliant--slick, dangerous, deceptive and unstable.  I found myself regretting Ari\\'s storyline being completed--he could have been Wo Fat to Gibbs\\' McGarrett (Hawaii Five-O reference).  It\\'s always fun when Jessica Steen drops in to trade remarks with Weatherly as Paula Cassidy.  Michael Bellisario\\'s turn as Abby\\'s lab assistant is a comical and dangerous turn.  Finally, we can\\'t forget Muse Watson\\'s introduction in the \"Hiatus\" episodes as Gibbs\\' mentor when he joined NIS, Mike Franks.  Franks\\' amusement at the changes--the female director in particular--are tempered by his having to fill in many of the blanks for Gibbs when Jethro is recovering from amnesia.Ultimately, the season of change that is NCIS Season 3 is a storytelling wonder--full of the humor and action that has been the staple of the series since it\\'s beginning, but also the undercurrent of melancholy that permeates this season.  The loss of Kate really becomes the latest in a series of painful losses for Gibbs--but we never realize it until the end of the season.']\n",

After ten years, this video is a very interesting look at the past, and the promises vs. the reality of what became of the Big Dig project.Ironically, or perhaps prophetically, the film begins by showing a section of new tunnel (at time = 2:06). This is the EXACT LOCATION where (on July 10, 2006) the ceiling collapsed on a car, killing passenger Milena Del Valle. The heavy concrete panels were glued in place with epoxy cement that had not been applied properly. It was ultimately determined that ceiling panels weren\\'t actually needed in that location, so today, the ceiling that appears in the video is no longer there.Such was the theme for most of the Big Dig\\'s design and construction. Too many things were \"never attempted before\",  \"biggest in the world\", \"cutting edge\", and/or other custom-designed or unproven technologies. At the same time, the well-connected engineering and construction contractors deliberately made things more complicated and expensive than necessary, so as to maximize their own profits. One notorious example of this became known as the \"Ginzu Guardrails\". Instead of using industry-standard round pipe hand rails in the tunnels, an engineering contractor ordered custom-designed stainless steel hand rails with sharp vertical edges. Besides being much more expensive, they earned the \"Ginzu\" moniker for their ability to slice through accident victims like a knife! Today, many of the original hand rails have been destroyed in accidents and have not been replaced; other sections have been deliberately removed because they are too dangerous. As was the case for the section of ceiling that collapsed, these hand rails were not really needed at all.Of course, it\\'s not all bad; the I-90 extension to the airport has been a great improvement. The Ted Williams tunnel (a.k.a. the Frozen Head tunnel) was one of the first sections to open and the quality of construction is much better than all of the other tunnel sections that were built later. Unfortunately, most of the tunnels under Boston were built very poorly and most disturbingly of all, were not properly sealed to be watertight. In the winter, the leaking water forms huge icicles and ice patches that require application of large amounts of salt inside the tunnels. The large volume of water; combined with the freeze-thaw cycles and corrosive salt effect; was not something the tunnels were designed for. Consequently, the concrete and steel in the tunnels is deteriorating much more rapidly than expected. In another ill-advised design, the aluminum tunnel ceiling light fixtures were attached with steel brackets. Two dissimilar metals in a moist, corrosive environment are always doomed to corrode, and sure enough, in February 2011 the fixtures began falling into the roadway. (they\\'re now temporarily held in place with plastic tie straps, but must all be replaced) As if the initial construction cost wasn\\'t bad enough, the ongoing maintenance costs of the Big Dig will only get worse as the shoddily constructed sections continue to fall apart.I could go on and on about so many other things, but the bottom line is that the cost of the Big Dig was way more expensive than expected and way more expensive than necessary. So much money was spent on this one project, that there was nothing left for other highway projects in Massachusetts, or for the mass transit projects that were initially promised as mitigation for the environmental effects. For most drivers in Boston, the traffic is just as bad if not worse, but instead of being stuck in traffic on Boston\\'s old elevated Central Artery where at least you had a nice view, now you\\'re stuck in traffic in ugly, filthy, crumbling tunnels.The film ends with another ironic quote at time = 33:03 - \"Nobody in five years or ten years is gonna remember the cost, they\\'re gonna look at this thing and say: \\'what a beautiful job\\' \".It would be laughable, if it weren\\'t so very sad.Note for road geeks: Time = 24:05 has a very old aerial view of the Charles River crossing, showing the original elevated ramps that connected the Upper/Lower deck to the Tobin Bridge. Time = 24:42 shows the City Square tunnel under construction in Charlestown, before the loop ramps and Leverett Connector bridge were built.']\n",

            " ['Warning!  Many spoilers!Additional Warning:  Thanks to Canadian and British television, the final episodes of STARGATE SG-1 have already been shown through much of the world.  The following review is based on having seen everything including the series finale.And so after an amazing ten year run, STARGATE SG-1 comes to a dignified end.  Sorta.  Plans for a couple of TV movies are already in the works, so the plot ends that are left somewhat open at the end of the series will probably be resolved at that time.  It is hard at this point to know what the show\\'s legacy will be.  It never received the critical acclaim that series like FARSCAPE, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, FIREFLY, or even BABYLON 5 received, and one can\\'t point to specific ways that it has altered or molded other Sci-Fi series, but simply being around for a decade is unprecedented in Sci-fi.  Yeah, DR. WHO has been around longer, but its presence has been far more episodic and it has sometimes been prey to a budget smaller than a kids\\' show (though certainly this is not the case for its present incarnation).  It certainly did a number of things right.  The writing remained strong throughout.  The production values were strong from beginning to end.  And if it never scaled the peaks of brilliance of other series it still managed to produce many memorable moments.  Perhaps its legacy is something to be set aside for a decade or so.What is amazing is that the tenth season was a largely successful effort at self-recreation.  Season Nine had been plagued by pregnancy.  Both Amanda Tapping and Claudia Black (and some of the outfits Ms. Black wore in Season Ten reveal that she has fully recovered from having given birth--the highlight of Season Ten might have been the outfit she wore in the high school reunion episode from near the end of the season) had children during that season.  I\\'m a huge fan of kids and having babies, but it doesn\\'t mesh well with making TV shows.  Tapping was missing for the early part of the season and Black for most of the middle.  Both were present for the entirety of Season Ten.  Black\\'s real life pregnancy fed into the plot of Season Ten, with her giving birth to a mystical child who became the super-empowered leader of the Ori.  Adria (played by Monica Baccarin, Inara from FIREFLY) grew into a full-grown woman with overwhelming powers in a matter of weeks.  Throughout the season SG-1 has to struggle against their most powerful foe yet, who nonetheless harbors affection towards her mother, hoping to convert her to a belief in the Ori.What makes Season Ten work for me above all else is Claudia Black as Vala.  Although I have long been a fan of the show, I\\'ve long felt that there was a central problem in the core cast.  Though Richard Dean Anderson\\'s Jack O\\'Neill was ever the wise cracker, there was a lack of genuine humor at the core of the show and despite the implied attraction between O\\'Neill and Samantha Carter, no real romantic chemistry.  But Vala is really, truly funny and a real sex post as well.  And it was brilliant to team her with the wound-too-tight Daniel Jackson rather than Col. Mitchell (which would have been expected, since Black and Ben Browder portrayed what was perhaps THE great romantic couple in all of TV Sci-fi, Aeryn Sun and John Crichton on FARSCAPE).  Vala and Jackson are great together, with the unconventional and free-spirited Vala both appealing to and threatening the Boy Scout Jackson.  As a huge fan of Claudia Black\\'s Aeryn Sun, who was a stern and serious character, it was delightful seeing her be such a goofball on this show.  All in all, her character brought a bit of anarchism that was frequently lacking on the show.  If I have a regret with the series coming to an end, it is in not knowing what happens to her next.  In one of the most endearing touches of the season, the Stargate program only very gradually decides to allow Vala to become a part of the SG-1 team.  The season\\'s opening credits start off with the main four marching through the gate, but the week after she is allowed to join, just as the four start to walk through, Vala scampers up to join them.The main plot for the final season focused on the ongoing struggle against the Ori, a group of ultra religious fanatics.  With religious fundamentalism dominating both domestic and international news, with both Christian fundamentalists in the US trying to force public opinion to conform with their beliefs and Islamic fundamentalists trying to force the rest of Islam to conform with their violent and intolerant readings of the Koran (readings that the vast majority of Muslims do not agree with), nothing could be more relevant than intolerant religious zealots who are willing to kill those who do not agree with them.There were some significant farewells in Season Ten.  Samantha\\'s father, who had seen his life extended several years by accepting a symbiote and becoming a member of the Tok\\'ra, finally did die.  And not only Thor, but also the entirety of the Asgard died as well.Although STARGATE SG-1 was noted for its huge, epic, cliffhanging finales, the series finale was surprisingly subdued and quiet.  But also, I thought, remarkably appropriate.  I\\'m sure there was the temptation of a \"Big Ending,\" but instead they decided to focus instead on a relatively unspectacular, intimate episode in which time is essentially frozen for a few decades.  The main five simply spend some time together, while Vala and Daniel actually live a life of romantic bliss.  Typically, they manage a brilliant scientific solution to their dilemma at the end, with only Teal\\'c retaining any memory of the preceding decades.  As the show ends he smiles bemusedly as Vala and Daniel fall into their bickering ways.  But we know the potential that remains.So, a classic series comes to an end.  It wasn\\'t the best Sci-fi series ever.  It wasn\\'t the most ground breaking.  And it isn\\'t likely to be one of the more influential.  But it was the longest running uninterrupted Sci-fi series in the history of Sci-fi and introduced us to a host of memorable characters.  Yeah, it had some unpleasant quirks.  It used \"Science as Magic\" to such a degree that it almost became a parody of itself.  It reused plots endlessly.  I mean, just how many alternate universe episodes did we really need?  And how many times were there multiple copies of the same character?  (I suspect that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA\\'s refusal to use the same plot device twice or to EVER employ science in magical fashion owes a great deal to the abuse of both by SG-1.)  Still, the show took us to a host of wonderful places, introduced us to some wonderful enemies, and continually managed to entertain and delight.  And we got to know the core group of characters quite well.  Not many shows get ten seasons; even fewer manage ten seasons so well.  The show was starting to seem a bit old by the end, but it managed to do what almost no series ever gets to do:  last ten years and still have something left in the tank at the end.']\n",

            " ['and everything in between during the 10th season of \"Stargate: SG-1\". By the way, this ISN\\'T the end of SG-1 as two direct-to-video TV movies are due in 2008 with stand alone storylines. During the 10th season we get to see the resolution of the conflict between the alliance and the Ori, the end of the Asgardians and the continuing blossoming romance between Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Vala (Claudia Black). The show went through a lot of change during the last three seasons as storylines were wrapped up, new storyarcs developed and new characters such as Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder well known to sci-fi fans from \"Farscape\")and Vala (Claudia Black anther \"Farscape\" alum)providing the show with an additional injection of energy. Beau Bridges came on board adding spark to the show as well. Richard Dean Anderson is missed during the 10th and final season but his spirit is kept very much alive by Browder and Black in their roles. Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge proved to the the strongest link in the chain between the old Stargate and new.The story arc episodes are among the best while some of the stand alone episodes are (with the exception of a few) probably the weakest of the 10th season seeming like filler at times. The stand-alone episodes may or may not appeal to you like those on \"The X-Files\" and \"Farscape\" these episodes stand or fall based on the strength of the plotting and how realistic the wrap up is within 45 minutes. Some episodes as a result are better than others with some abrupt resolutions using the old ex deus machina (represented as help from Stargate Command or other sources sometimes unexpected)where more time could have been devoted to the story expanding it over more than one episode. As a long time \"Farscape\" fan I was happy to tag along after the cast changes and found that if you gave the final two seasons a chance, they were extremely good at the best of times.The show experienced a lot of change during the last three seasons which would make one expect them to be lesser seasons than the previous 7. Nothing could be further from the truth. The new characters were perfect additions to the show adding after the departure of Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack O\\'Neil. The addition of Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry to replace long time cast member Don Davis (Davis\\' character was promoted and he appeared in a couple of episodes during season nine)who played Major General George Hammond and various guest stars (Fred Willard, Robert Picardo a regular on \"Star Trek: Voyager\" started appearing in season 9) helped spruce up the last season of the show. It also helped that the Ori story arc was nicely resolved during the last season as well.The show looks pretty good but there are some digital artifacts evident in the transfers. Most of you won\\'t notice them or care but for those that do keep in mind the amount of information packed on each disc. The 10th season has been packaged in the slimline packaging that was rolled out with season 8. I\\'m sure these will show up on Blu-Ray but the show looks fine here and is well priced.The DVD has commentary tracks for every episode except one (and I suspect that was probably an accident as one episode has TWO commentary tracks. They probably scheduled the wrong episode for the second commentary track), deleted scenes, featurettes in the Director\\'s Series focusing on 1 director for 1 episode of each disc.

Some of the dialogue is spoken so quickly and mumbled that I found it hard to make out. Some have made a bit much of the Boston accents here. I'm from Massachusetts. Mitchum's accent isn't bad, but it's not fully real. His performance as the small-time crook-turned-rat who fears going back to jail is fine, but it's no Oscar winner. I did like the depiction of early 70s Boston and its suburbs, replete with many of the horrible vintage 60s and 70s Detroit autos of the period. Seeing them again made me shudder. This was based on what was probably George Higgins' best crime novel. I've never read it. Don't expect today's production values with this film. Everything moves a lot more slowly, and many shots needed tighter editing.\"]\n",

It\\'s the cold end of fall, filled with drab, chill days where parking lot asphalt is always wet. We\\'re into Eddie\\'s life in the low lane, where the anchors in the crummy strip malls are a tired Woolworth\\'s and Barbo\\'s Furniture Store. It\\'s a lousy life and it belongs to Eddie Coyle. \"Have a nice day.\"Director Peter Yates sets up scenes -- an exchange of machine guns, a bank robbery, a family held hostage, a stakeout in a commuter train lot, a night on the town -- that are so naturally established that we might miss how skillfully they build the story and show us Eddie\\'s life. We\\'re never sure if things are as hopeless for Eddie as they seem. Yates keeps us on edge, and he adds layers of Eddie Coyle\\'s sad and foolish trust.This is one of Robert Mitchum\\'s best performances. Mitchum still looks like he might be a tough guy, but his Eddie Coyle is a man who has had the force of his life wrung out of him. He\\'s been in the life forever. He does the jobs others ask him to. He doesn\\'t ask very many questions. He\\'s just not smart enough. Mitchum takes all the hard edges off his usual persona and gives us an aging loser whose life is on the skids, and who doesn\\'t understand just how badly off he is.The Criterion release looks just fine.

True, many of his films were not worthy of his talent, but when he did get a good script (e.g. THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, HEAVEN KNOWS MR. ALLISON, CAPE FEAR), his performance was always mesmerizing.Arguably, Mitchum\\'s finest screen performance can be found in THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE (1973), now available on DVD from The Criterion Collection.Directed by Peter Yates, who supplies audio commentary on the disc, the film is set in Boston and casts Mitchum as a small-time felon, a family man facing a 2-5 year sentence on a smuggling conviction.  His only hope of avoiding prison is to give an FBI agent (Richard Jordan) information that will help to bring down some bigger bad guys...like the men who have been on a bank-robbing spree and killed a teller during their last job.Mitchum\\'s problem is that, if he \"rats\" on those guys, his life is not worth a plugged nickel.Peter Boyle co-stars in the picture, playing Mitchum\\'s \"friend,\" a former felon who is now a bartender and also supplies confidential information to the Feds.Adapted from the novel by George V. Higgins by Paul Monash, this is a gritty, first-rate crime drama, shot in almost a semi-documentary style.

            " ['\"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\", adapted from the novel by George V. Higgins, is exemplary of the kind of film noir that was unique to the 1970s. It shares the chaotic noir world with films of the 1940s, but protagonist is fast being rendered irrelevant by a rapidly changing world where even corruption isn\\'t what it used to be, and he knows it. It\\'s fitting, then, that the protagonist should be played by an aging Robert Mitchum, conflicted hero of more than a few films of the classic noir cycle. Eddie Coyle (Robert Mitchum) is a hood who runs guns for the Boston mob. Caught in a recent trucking job set up by his bar-owning friend Dillon (Peter Boyle), Coyle is looking at a probable 3-5 years in prison. He can\\'t afford to do the time, so he considers snitching on his gun supplier to a federal agent, Dave Foley (Richard Jordan), but the feds are more interested in a recent string of bank robberies.Eddie Coyle is a man from another era. He ponders how much and whom he is willing to betray to keep himself out of prison. He paternalistically lectures his young gun supplier (Steven Keats) about how rough the business is and the importance of caution and reliability. Eddie is playing by some old rulebook that is no longer applies. He doesn\\'t realize he\\'s being played by just about everyone. He catches on too late to how the game of cops and robbers is currently conducted. \"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\" was an ironic title for a cynical and depressed era. Made the year the Watergate scandal broke, it\\'s hardly surprising that law enforcement is portrayed as no more ethical than outright criminality. Shot on location in Boston, director Peter Yates\\' style is unadorned but includes a lot of procedure -how guns are obtained and banks robbed- that enhance the film\\'s aura of authenticity.The DVD (Criterion Collection 2009): Spine #475.

            " ['\"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\" is a 1970\\'s crime movie, with great dialogue, acting, and intrigue. The movie reminded me of \"The Sopranos\" more than classic film noir. \"Eddie Coyle\" is more realistic and subdued than a lot of noir. It also has a lot of criminals interacting: pulling capers, making deals, and distrusting each other, like some of the criminals in \"The Sopranos\". It\\'s centered more on the interaction of the characters and the story than on action. There are several great scenes, where the dialogue and the acting are engaging, particularly when Robert Mitchum speaks. I\\'ve never been a fan of Robert Mitchum, but here he\\'s excellent, bringing a lot of emotion and weariness to Eddie Coyle. The story is also very good, as we see Eddie struggle to stay out of jail. The DVD is from The Criterion Collection, and looks good. There is a new commentary track from director Peter Yates.

            " [\"As I've said in all my reviews, I love the Stargate shows SG-1 and Atlantis, not so Universe.  I like the way they spun off the whole Atlantis discovery as the foundation for extending SG-1 which was great, but ran it's course and was in decline at the end.  It allowed some new characters, albeit with familiar personalities, along with keeping alive some old favorites with vague tie in's to their ongoing lives as well as bringing Samantha Carter back for a season to head the program (in addition to all her guest appearances).  I think the 3rd season of Atlantis was its best.  I knew from the start it would have a shorter shelf life than SG=1 because the premiss had already been pretty thoroughly explored in SG=1. A whole new universe allowed for some new bad guys, but the SG teams and the predicaments they can get into are finite before they are like plots different show.  I enjoyed their greater familiarity with the ancient technology but being Hyperspace or Warp drives, the technology is simply a backdrop to the episode storyline and seasonal/show ones.  I couldn't have stood waiting as long watching Stargate for them to develop defensive technologies and fight the enemies effectively.  I enjoyed the show and season 3 was at its peak as it was becoming a formula rotated through the seasons by season 4 and season 5 it is hard to get enthused when it begins by them canning a long time character who was well liked by fans and characters, replacing her with someone that I would have enjoyed having run Stargate for two shows and then get eaten by a Raithe no matter how much they tried to make it fun watching him have to change his ways to deal with the realities of being in the field.  The characters had become familiar such that losing main ones was difficult in this season making for some heavy shows, but also began the rotation that made it less upsetting when one was lost.  The only thing that sort of always left me in question was how on Atlantis they dealt with exploring an entire Galaxy with a few SG teams while back in the Milky Way they had a ton.  I realize there were more finite resources in the beginning, but by season 3 they had the huge city fairly up and running and enough trade partners to support a much larger military presence which all things considered I think back home on earth they would have been cranking out as many starships as possible because in the big picture they would need a fleet not a couple of ships.  i know they added on, but over years given the stakes I believe an international governing body would be funding mass production of those things so there was always one by earth, one by Atlantis and others for missions and with force.  It is part of what started to become a little to familiar, the desperate situation with impossible odds solved by a miraculous discovery at the last minute.  Great for a show, or a movie, but when it becomes cyclical it eventually translates to a show formula and the interest just begins to wane.  I did appreciate the writing around the problems they faced were of their own making many times (waking the wraithe early, messing with the replicator programming, genetic experiments on the wraithe to make them human) and the moral questions they raise in parallel with the real world application of genetics.  How much knowledge is to much before we are dabbling in areas we don't have enough seem to be evolved enough to have in our hands as they represent to much power, to much danger.  But for Star Gate fans I think Atlantis was a comfortable spin off that allowed a few more years of enjoyment of their &#34;world&#34; but unlike the Star Trek franchise that dealt with all universes the &#34;world&#34; created via the stargates became to self contained limiting the growth of the plots.  Bottom line is by this season you know what your getting and enjoying it, where in the seasons to come it started to get old and thus the show faded away.  Good, even great for periods, but limited from the start by being set in the present.  Great run while it lasted.\"]\n",

Sure, they appear in a few good episodes, but it didn\\'t seem like the story with respect to them in particular moved at all.Second, killing off Dr. Beckett.  I really liked him.  Maybe I\\'m dating myself a bit here, but he was kind of like Scotty and McCoy rolled together but with a cooler head.  This very lovable character will be missed.Third, rehashing the replicators.  With an entirely new galaxy as our backdrop for this series, why do the replicator thing all over again?  It was original enough on Stargate SG-1, but I was amazed that Atlantis started a story arc with replicators too.  Are they going creatively bankrupt already?Fourth, rehashing old sci-fi standbys, like the \"weird alien thingy or disease that causes loyal comrades to start killing each other\".  Did the original Star Trek do this in the episode \"The Naked Time\" and wasn\\'t it done again by Star Trek Next Generation as the second or third episode in that series?Fifth, bringing back a whole ship full of \"ancients\" just to kill them all off by the end of the two part episode.  So, the \"ancients\" have gone from being a great and mysterious race of humanoids from the past to an expediant plot device.  We can create them and destroy them at will just to get and episode or two.  Couldn\\'t an \"ancient\" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters?  Wouldn\\'t that have been interesting?  They could have helped explore the rest of the city.  Their ship could have been recovered.  There\\'s so much that could have been done with them that wasn\\'t.Sixth, lack of character development.  Tayla could be a full-fledged warrior princess with a rich heritage and tons of wisdom, but she seems little more than a pretty (to say the least) face with a great body who never uses contractions (reminds me of Barbara Eden in I Dream of Jeanie) and tilts her head a lot.  And then there\\'s Ronan the Monotone Macho man who does nothing for me but must appeal to a certain demographic so he\\'s still there.Still, the season ended with a special effects spectacular and a tightly written script that showed just what the Atlantis team is capable of.  And, of course there\\'s the wealth of special features and commentaries that you get as part of the standard package with Stargate franchise DVD sets, and that greatly adds to the value of the set.I haven\\'t seen any of season four.

While Shepard is no Jack O'Neill he has started getting his own personality it seems that fits the series well and while the super model leader Teyla still feels unneeded she has become somewhat less annoying in the series as well.

            " ['Warning!  There are multiple spoilers in the following review!I\\'ve watched STARGATE ATLANTIS from the beginning and have more or less enjoyed it from the start.  I definitely plan on continuing to watch it, but I have some concerns about the show that I\\'m convinced have to be addressed for it to continue to be worth watching.First and foremost, ATLANTIS has always had and continues to have serious cast problems.  They have now had three complete seasons to address these problems and while they have played with it some, most of their decisions have been odd at best.  I really like Joe Flannigan as Sheppard and David Hewlett as Rodney, but beyond that the cast is mainly made up of liabilities.  There was one other actor I liked a lot on the show, Paul McGillion as Beckett, but inexplicably in remaking the cast they chose to kill off one of the few strong characters on the show.  Rachel Luttrell as Teyla is more baffling.  Her character has never been very interesting, but I\\'m not convinced that Luttrell is untalented.  I suspect that for whatever reason the writers have simply not been willing or able to come up with any interesting arcs for her (apart from having an interesting connection to the wraiths, which by and large has been underutilized).  My hope is that they will rethink Teyla and either do both her and us a favor and kill her off, or become more aggressive in writing her character and give her some significant arcs and character development.  Jason Momoa as Ronon, however, is probably a lost cause.  He is perhaps the most wooden actor on television today and they have done virtually nothing of interest with his character.  David Nykl, however, is good as Zelenka.  I always enjoy his scenes with Rodney.  Finally, I really want to like Torri Higginson (not least because she bears a scary resemblance to an ex-girlfriend of mine).  I love shows that feature strong and interesting female characters, but after three years she remains yet another character with whom they\\'ve been unable to do very much.  In her case, however, it appears that the producers have decided to either write her out of the show entirely or reduce her merely to a recurring character.  I will continue to watch and sometimes enjoy STARGATE ATLANTIS, but they really need to do some serious rehabilitation.Some help is on the way.  We know that Amanda Tapping and her character Samantha Carter will be moving over from the cancelled STARGATE SG-1 to become the new head of the Atlantis project.  I think she will bring more strength to the role than Torri Higginson did.  Normally I would also applaud the casting of Jewel Staite as the new base doctor.  I loved her on FIREFLY as Kaylee, but I still regret Beckett\\'s leaving the show.  But I honestly feel that the cast needs several more major changes.  The show has had to rely far too heavily on Sheppard and Rodney.The end of Season Three did, however, leave hope for new and better things.  Atlantis has emerged as the name not of a location that cannot be moved, but of a truly mobile city that can relocate . . . well, to anywhere.  The season ends with the city blasting off into space.  I\\'m anxious to see what happens next.  But whatever they do, I would like to see the show continue the risks it started taking in Season Three.  Killing Beckett was an abominable mistake (especially given that there were some other characters who could have been killed with far greater profit to the show), but it at least started giving the show something that both it and SG-1 have always lacked:  a body count.  The good adventure shows have body counts.  SG-1 had next to none.  The only truly heartbreaking death in ten seasons was when Dr. Frasier was killed.  It is no accident that that the episode in which that occurred was one of the finest in the series\\' run.  If you don\\'t have a body count, you get no sense of danger.  On shows like BUFFY, LOST, and BATTLESTAR GALACTIC they have killed off some important characters.  As a result when a character is in danger you get a degree of danger that you never, ever get on ATLANTIS or SG-1.  Well, at least until they killed off Beckett and at least seriously injured Weir.  I dearly hope they continue doing this in the future.I also hope that we see Season Four taking the stories of the Wraith and the replicators to newer and more complex levels.  The series has had some great moments over the first three seasons, especially when they let situations get really desperate.  Hopefully they will continue to do this.While Season Three frequently left me wanting more due to the weaknesses in the overall cast, there were some great moments.  The season finale (both SG-1 and ATLANTIS have had some fine season enders) was splendid.  And the season featured what may be my favorite episode of the entire series so far in \"Common Ground,\" in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a wraith who is allowed to feed on no one else.  Christopher Heyerdahl has played several wraiths on the series, but in this episode he was allowed to give this particular wraith a dignity and complexity not allowed any other wraith with the exception of Michael.  He gradually drains the life out of Sheppard out of sheer necessity before the two of them, cooperating as human and wraith never have before, manage to escape from the Genii.  Then, in a moment that could lead to interesting plot developments in the future, we discover that the wraiths cannot only drain another creature of life, they can also imbue them with it, and as a sign of comradeship he heals Sheppard.  I want arcs like this one!  On a host of other series some of the most interesting characters have been those who came over from the other side.  On STAR TREK: VOYAGER, we had Seven of Nine; on BUFFY we had Angel, Anya, and Spike; currently on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA we have Sharon Agathon and (possibly) Caprica Six; and on SG-1 we had Teal\\'c.  I think it would be fascinating if they could do something like that with a wraith.So I wait for the beginning of Season Four with some nervousness.  The show has some weaknesses and problems, but they are fixable.  The series has not lost any of its potential.

            " ['This is by far the best season so far. I kept looking forward for nighttime to watch an episode.One thing I like about this season is that some episodes follow on the previous ones. In other words, many episodes are not standalone. Many viewers do prefer standalone episodes, and producers certainly do. For producers, having standalone episodes means a viewer can jump in and watch the series at anytime during the season. This has the benefit of increasing ratings. For some viewers, standalone episodes are also an advantage since they can watch and enjoy an episode without having seen any other episodes. I, on the other hand, prefer continuity, sort of like 24 Hours. For this reason, I thought this season of Stargate Atlantis to be the best.I do have a few comments about this season:1. Dr. Beckett dies in a very simple plot. I was really very disappointed. Beckett was one of my favorite characters, and I often wished he was given more of a principal role. The writers also did a lousy job in the episode in which he was killed. They could have killed him off in two or three one-hour episodes that followed up on each other, thus adding more suspense and thrill. On the other side of the coin, though, killing off a principal character also means that all characters on the show are susceptible to death--none are superhuman. We know James Bond never dies in his movies. However, next time a character is threatened with death in Stargate Atlantis, we will be glued to our seats, wondering whether he or she will die! `Death in the air\\' makes the episodes more suspenseful.2. The character of Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) has not been developed, and she does not have much to say that is interesting. She is also dressed up in a way to make her look sexy. Shouldn\\'t she be wearing a uniform? Can you imagine a female soldier in Iraq wearing her outfit?3. Jason Momoa as Ronon is another underdeveloped character. Sometimes he is annoying. He also is sparsely dressed, being topless most of the time. Like Teyla, I would imagine he\\'d wear a uniform. Don\\'t they ever get cold?4. Dr. Weir\\'s (Torri Higginson) character is also weak. She should be given more principal roles. There are rumors that she might be replaced in upcoming seasons.5. There is too much Rodney in this season, and this gets to be annoying at times.6. In one episode, a ship full of ancients is found. They reclaim Atlantis, and basically kick out the Stargate team from the city, who all return back to Earth. However, in the second episode they are all killed. That was really bad storytelling. As one reviewer pointed out, couldn\\'t an \"ancient\" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters in latter episodes? They could have helped explore the rest of the city and reveal its many secrets. We could have also known more about the ancients and their culture. Furthermore, their ship could have been recovered and used to fight the Wraiths. There\\'s so much that could have been done with the surviving ancients that wasn\\'t.7. The episode \"Common Ground,\" in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a Wraith was fascinating. We discover that the Wraiths not only drain another creature of life, but can also give life as well. For the first time, a bond is formed between a Wraith and a human. Wraiths are shown to be human after all. Humans hunt and kill prey (animals) in order to survive. Wraiths kill humans because we are prey to them, and they need to feed on us to survive. Viewed in this context, aren\\'t Wraiths and humans the same? It all boils down to survival of the fittest.The season ends with the city blasting off into space. Having lost all power, it just floats in space. I can\\'t wait for season 4!']\n",

The other convicts lives are on the line as well since all of them have been ordered to be killed. They also want Dr. Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies) dead or anyone else who has tried to help Scofield and his brother. To show that these guys aren't messing around, season 1 regular Veronica (Robin Tunney) is killed violenty at the end of the first episode of this season.William Fichtner plays Agent Alexander Mahone who we think just wants to catch them but it later turns out that he has been ordered to kill them. Plus that's not all that makes this guy a threat....he's extremely smart and always seems to know what Scofield's next move is going to be. Which is another thing that makes this season so thrilling. You never really know what this guy is going to do next or who he's going to find next. I was hoping he'd find and kill T-Bag (Robert Knepper) but that sleaze ball makes it through the whole season. I don't wanna see this guy die because Knepper is bad at playing him or anything. I wanna see him die because Knepper is fantastic at making you hate this worthless piece of garbage. He's a rat that kills innocent people and slizzers his way away through most the season.Paul Adelstein as Agent Paul Kellerman is back after Scofield and Burrows. But he makes some important decisions as the season goes on and turns out to be just what they need if they want to clear Burrows' name. So there's a lot of character development going on in this season. There's a lot of running going on this season but since this show has great writing it's always engaging and you never really know what is going to happen next. So it's not just a whole lot of brainless chase scenes through the whole season. It's always exciting and has you at the edge of your seat. Plus there is still some scenes where they are captured and have to figure out how to escape. Hell this season has everything really. It's really a must see!\"]\n",
            " ['The first season of \"Prison Break\" was amazing and it solidified it as one of the best new shows on network television. When it ended, with the escape of 8 of the convicts; I wondered how they would keep the show going. Well, they did it...The 2nd season is different from season 1 in scenery and in story. And, I\\'m going to get this out of the way right now, it\\'s not quite as good as season 1. The first season was smart, suspenseful, and entertaining. Season 2 is suspenseful and entertaining...But not a single episode on here captured the heart-pounding 2nd to last episode of season 1. Still, viewing all these episodes a 2nd time (I watched them all while they were airing); It\\'s still an amazing show. When the show begins; Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) have successfully broken out of Fox River. Along with them are John Abruzzi (Peter Stormare), Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco),David \"Tweener\" Apolskiss (Lane Garrison, who\\'s had a recent run-in with the law himself), Theodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell (Robert Knepper), Benjamin \"C-Note\" Miles Franklin, and Haywire. With the entire world knowing their faces, they \"Fox River 8\" begin running...With new character, F.B.I. man Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) guessing their every move. This season develops the relationship between Michael and Sara, the doctor who aided the cons in their escape, and also makes you feel more for the characters. One amazing aspect of this show is that you actually like the characters and want them to succeed despite their wrongdoings. The best example I have of this is the character T-Bag, a convicted rapist & pedophile who is easily the most dangerous of the bunch. Many viewers of this show have a strong connection to T-Bag and love the character. This is not a result of good writing, but a result of good acting. Robert Knepper plays this character so well, you root for T-Bag to succeed. You don\\'t want to see him killed off or shipped back to prison. The fact that the Emmy awards haven\\'t even acknowledged Knepper is a complete travesty. If this was a movie, Knepper would be nominated for an Oscar. But all the actors are good and with season 2, they\\'ve only got better at playing the roles. They\\'re gotten under their character\\'s skin and have really became them. The chemistry between Miller and Purcell is terrific. You believe that they are actually brothers. Fichtner as Mahone is terrific as well. He has that icy stare and intenseness that John Malkovich has and does an amazing job as the sympathetic F.B.I. agent that you love to hate. Like I said, the show isn\\'t as smart as season 1...There\\'s many episodes where they seemed to make up things as they went along (Michael\\'s tattoo has become a ploy and a plot device. The writer\\'s can make new tattoos appear whenever they wish) and the way they handled the Haywire character could have been better. There were times when they disregarded him for several episodes, when really he should have been caught by episode 3. There\\'s no way that Haywire could\\'ve remained out longer than Abruzzi. But the suspense factor is way up there. Every episode has me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next (Even though, I already knew which makes it even more impressive). If you haven\\'t jumped on the \"Prison Break\" bandwagon yet, you should...I missed the season 3 premiere last night and I truly want to cry, because I can\\'t wait to see what happens next. When you have a TV show that can you get that pumped up, you know you\\'ve found something special...And \"Prison Break\" is damned special all right. Fine acting, terrific writing, and nail-biting suspense. I said this is my review for season 1 a long time ago, but I\\'m going to state it again. If this was a movie, you can bet that Oscars would be involved.GRADE: A']\n",
            " [\"As the second season of Prison Break opens, things get moving along rather quickly.  Michael (Wentworth Miller), Linc (Dominic Purcell), Sucre (Amaury Nolasco), C-Note (Rockmond Dunbar), and John (Peter Stormare) have escaped from prison and are on the run.  After going their seperate ways, shady FBI Agent Mahone (William Fichtner) arrives on the scene with one main intention: stop Michael and Linc from escaping the country.  In the meantime, T-Bag (Robert Knepper) goes to some great lengths to get what he wants, and Captain Bellick (Wade Williams) is still hot on the brothers' trail.  The conspiracy that was apparent in season one is even more farther reaching here, as revelations are made that will cost everyone involved dearly, and by the end of the season, not everyone that has been here since the beginning will still be standing.  What makes Prison Break so good is that the show never relents from it's break neck pacing.  This could easily be a bad thing, but the minds behind Prison Break manage to keep the constant flow stable enough so you never know what to expect next.  Even with the major change of scenery for the main characters, the show stays more compelling than ever as it becomes a high octane game of cat and mouse.  Undoubtedly one of (if not the) best shows on prime time network television today (and on Fox), Prison Break just keeps getting better, and by the end of the season finale, you'll be salivating for more.\"]\n",

T-Bag's twisted logic tells him that his former lover will take him back into her home, but he doesn't face reality.

            " ['My overriding impression of \"Bones Season 2\" is that perhaps Booth and Brennan were getting too close in season one, and forces needed to be put in place to put some distance between the two. The first was by replacing Jonathan Adams (Dr. Daniel Goodman) with Tamara Taylor (Dr. Camille Saroyan) as Brennan\\'s boss, who, by the way, had a romantic relation with Booth when they were in New York. The second was to introduce a romantic interest for Brennan, in the form of FBI agent Tim Sullivan (Sully), who replaces Booth while he is sidelined for a psychiatric evaluation by the premier guest character on \"Bones\", Gordon, Gordon Wyatt, played by Stephen Fry.Wyatt and Booth have some of the most delicious scenes outside of the episodes where Booth and Brennan get close.In retrospect, it is just a bit hard to take the interchange between Brennan and Saroyan in the first few episodes. Booth is surprised at her arrival, and resists Saroyan\\'s direction. I suppose the reason it\\'s odd is because we all suspect from the outset that in the lab, and with Booth, Brennan will always be the alpha dog. After all, the show is named after her.Overall, I would say season 2 is as good as season 1, and better than season 3 (It is rated better than both seasons 1 and 3.) Season 1 had the \"getting to work together jitters\" and season 2 had the \"separation moves\". The main season 3 arc was simply not as good.']\n",

All kinds of things take place in the 2nd season with more storylines resolved and new ones opened up.  They are just as addictive and compelling as the first season and they even have an addition to the team as a whole in a new director (Tamara Taylor) for the Jeffersonian.I love the way the season progresses with the different members of the team reaching new personal goals and other things (marriage (sorta), promotion).  It's exciting to see a show this good actually stick around for more than a minute.

            " ['O Happy Day! As presented in widescreen, here\\'s Season 2 of Bones. The great news is that there\\'s no slack off at all from season one\\'s most excellent run. Involving forensic conundrums and grim visions of death once again winningly meld with great drama, humor, pathos, and tenuous romance. Emily Deschanel as forensic anthropologst Dr. Temperance \"Bones\" Brennan and David Boreanaz as FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) continue to dazzle as television\\'s most electric investigative duo.Whereas Booth is the intuitive people person, Brennan is still mostly socially in the dark. She remains dispassionate and driven in her pursuit of her personal Holy Grail, the truth. As always, her ability for drawing accurate observations from ruined human remains proves invaluable in solving FBI cases. As ever, the perceptive Booth and her free spirited best friend Angela are her main conduits to understanding the, to her, bewildering labyrinth of emotions and social decorum. Deschanel is great at allowing the audience to glimpse the wounds just beneath Bones\\' supremely confident exterior. She and Boreanaz are magical, and their chemical synergy remains the overwhelming draw of this series.There\\'s a barrage of big technical jargon used on each episode, but that doesn\\'t keep me from being sofa-ed in rapt attention. This show is so clever that my attitude more or less echoes Booth\\'s: \"Keep talking. I\\'ll catch up.\" The mysteries are compelling enough, but when thrown in with the engrossing human elements, it makes me want to tune in to the show that much more. The squints, while intimidatingly brainy and toiling away on a wavelength drastically foreign from that of average folks, are nevertheless engaging and very sympathetic characters. The supporting cast is remarkably good and quirky, bolstered by this season\\'s newcomer Tamara Taylor and by occasional guest stints by Ryan O\\'Neal, Stephen Fry, and the wonderful Patricia Belcher (as no-nonsense attorney Caroline Julian). It must be noted that T.J. Thyne (Hodgins) and Michaela Conlin (Angela) share an endearing chemistry.Season 2 introduces a couple of curve balls, beginning with the arrival of Dr. Camille Saroyan (Taylor) as Brennan\\'s new boss at the Jeffersonian Institute, with whom Bones instantly clashes. Then mix in some office romances (except the one we\\'re hankering for). Offer up a serial killer or two. And, thru all the cases she works on, Bones still fixates on her mother\\'s unsolved murder and her father\\'s disappearance. On this, some light will be shed.My favorite episodes are \"The Truth in the Lye\" (Tub of goo!! So cool tub of goo!! To quote Bones: \"Even for me, this is disgusting.\"), \"The Woman in the Sand\" (Booth goes ultimate fighting and, Omigawd, Bones in a sexy black cocktail dress!), \"Aliens in a Spaceship\" (Hodgins and Brennan are entombed in a car and must come up with makeshift ways to surviva as air runs out; raw-emotioned acting by Thyne and Deschanel), the nerve-wracking \"The Blonde in the Game\" and its equally harrowing follow-up \"The Man in the Cell\" features the return of clever serial killer Howard Epps from last season\\'s \"A Man on Death Row\") and the season-ender \"Stargazer in the Puddle\" (Bones learns more about her mother).Special Features include optional episode commentaries on \"The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House\" (with Emily Deschanel) and on \"Stargazer in a Puddle.\" Boreanaz doesn\\'t commentate this time; perhaps, his effort last season was deemed too loopy. Disc 6 offers \"The Memories in the Season\" featurette; \"Visceral Effects: The Digital Illusions of Bones\" featurette; 8 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by the Executive Producers; and the gag reel.By the way, the episode commentary on \"The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House\" reveals that an unaired 22nd episode will debut in the third season. Does that mean there\\'ll be 23 episodes in season 3? One hopes (but doubts).']\n",
            " [\"This second season is exploring new ways and avenues where bones are of course multiplying at leisure and for our best pleasure. Yet this second season is quite new in several aspects.First and foremost the season is widely open to personal matters and it explores the private, and at times not so private, relations between the members of the team, after the boss has been changed to a woman, which rebalances the sexual ratios. Bones herself is courting and going out with an FBI agent who has temporarily replaced Booth while he was sort of suspended and deprived of a gun after shooting a clown on top of an ice-cream vendor's van. But in the end she will not go through the process completely as far as leaving the Jeffersonian for a life of full leisure and farniente.Zack manages to get his doctorate and to be hired in the job he was holding as an intern because he goes to Angela and begs for help on his  look and manages to become presentable, which means he can now stand in court and testify seriously in a deportment that can carry the agreement of the jury. So far he is no longer obsessed by sexuality but he encounters a great difficulty: he is summoned by the White House to go to Iraq. But this time this reference does not lead to any political dissertation or even cogitation on the subject. Political questions are systematically and carefully avoided in this second season.Jack and Angela are finally realizing they love each other and even decide to get married and they finally find themselves in front of a priest (in fact a black priestess) in some church for the last step when the State Department steps in and reveals Angela is already married in some kind of broom stick over-jumping ceremony. More later, I guess.Booth is entangled in the hands of a British shrink after his shooting the clown on the ice-cream vendor's van and he is a perfect sucker, building a full barbecue for the shrink under the shrink's blackmailing procedure of retaining the document he must sign. This same shrink will also step into Bones' psyche as some kind of private counselor. Agent Booth and Doctor Brennan will not be able to establish some kind of personal relationship, especially since Temperance's father reappears in her life and even saves the situation a couple of times. But he has to be arrested by Booth and be brought to court for his ancient crimes, including the attack against the deputy chief of the FBI, though this one was crooked to the utmost, his lips kissing the heels of his shoes or something like that.Booth reestablishes for a short while a relationship with the new boss of the institute, Dr Camille Saroyan, with whom he had had a liaison some time ago in another life. But that cannot last more than one or two episodes. This is characteristic of all these people: they are unable psychologically or administratively to build balanced and normal relationships. Is it a side effect of their jobs or professions, we can wonder, or simply  personal immaturity?That level of the season blurs out the various crimes and cases they examine and solve. And these cases do not deal with political issues or even with immigration, except one case about some strange Chinese practice of burying the bones of a man with the bones of a woman so that the man has some company on the other side of the road. Most cases are plain simple crimes in America and among Americans. But they often deals with social problems like the mother of a severely handicapped girl: what can the mother do to help her child the genetic victim of a deadly disease that keeps her retarded, even if it is only for a short time before she dies? Some of these questions are crucial: do we have the right to experiment on human beings new treatments that would enable astronauts to reinforce their bones that get highly decalcified due to prolonged sojourn in space?Some of the cases are plain vicious crimes and it is fun to catch the killers who are most of the time not at all the one or the ones we were expecting. Suspense is always with us even if the personal and more sentimental level of this season makes that suspense not as intense as I would personally prefer it to be.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID\"]\n",

That's a higher batting average than the first season.The other episodes are still good, almost always watchable, (one or two really don't work), but often you can see the twistscoming a mile off, or the jokes get a little stale.The show is at it's best when the episodes are really about the often funny, sometimes heartbreaking inner lives ofour running characters, and not simply about brilliantly (and inevitably) catching the bad guy/gal.

            " ['Season 4 of NCIS comes off as more a labyrinth than \"The Season Of Secrets\" as CBS promoted it.  The main characters all seem to start in different areas--Gibbs in Mexico, Tony as Team Leader, Tim no longer the \"Probie\", Ziva being Ziva...but as the season rolls on, all the lines start coming together.  Jethro\\'s return from Mexico isn\\'t exactly greeted by Jenny Sheppard, and Ducky Mallard\\'s indifference to Gibbs is puzzling.  Tony is in a serious relationship (Or is he?), and it\\'s driving Ziva to distraction.  Tim has suddenly come into money--lots of it, evidently.  Abby is falling for a little person.  Ducky\\'s assistant Jimmy Palmer is finding himself in a hot affair with the new Probie.And Jenny is running an off-the-books investigation that gets the Christians In Action (Initials, folks) upset at NCIS.It\\'s a complicated season where all the characters undergo some changes; mostly pleasant but some not.  Mark Harmon brings Gibbs back from Mexico a little softer (Though not to the team)--enough to allow himself a relationship.  Michael Weatherly gets to have Tony grow up--some--and have his well-known intrusiveness into his coworker\\'s private lives flipped on him by Ziva.  Cote De Pablo allows the Mossad liason to fall for an ill-fated nuclear inspector in \"Dead Man Walking\", but Ziva starts having \"Tony issues\" that don\\'t slap her in the face until the end of the season.  Pauley Perrette\\'s Abby is as she ever is--the attempt to give up \"Kaff-Pow!!\" was classic.  David McCallum\\'s Ducky allows some hurt to show through in his relationship with Gibbs early in the year.  Brian Dietzen and Liza Lapira\\'s sequences in-and-around the morgue were wonderful asides, and made up for the missing \"head slaps\".But Lauren Holly was most intriguing in this season.  She took a character which some viewers considered cheesecake in Season 3, and gave her a very uneasy edge.  The investigation of La Grenouille seemed legitimate, but as the season went on, Jen\\'s personal stake--and what it could cost NCIS--became apparent.  This led to Sheppard not being cast in a good light through much of the second half of the season.This season also became a good spotlight for many of the recurring characters.  Certainly key to the season were Susanna Thompson--Hollis Mann, the CID investigator who got Gibbs\\' attention--and Scottie Thompson as Jeanne Benoit, the doctor who made DiNozzo settle down.  Joe Spano\\'s usual visits as T.C. Fornell, the FBI agent/friend/rival to Jethro were a delight.  But Muse Watson\\'s Mike Franks--Gibbs\\' team leader when Jethro first joined the then-NIS--was a treat; an old-fashioned type who got things done not within the rules (Wonder where Jethro got that from?).  We lose Jessica Steen\\'s Paula Cassidy in \"Grace Period\", and that\\'s a shame.  But Armand Assante\\'s was insidious and slick as \"The Frog\", and David Dayan Fisher\\'s turn as Trent Kort--the CIA operative in with La Grenouille--is also notable.In it\\'s run, NCIS has always had an ongoing storyline that gets buried in the usual action--the identity of the terroist who infiltrated the MTAC in Season 1, the return of Ari leading to the two words (\"Sorry, Caitlin\") at the end of Season 2, and the uncovering of Jethro\\'s life story in Season 3.  Season 4 becomes about Jenny\\'s  investigation/obsession, and how it affects the whole office.  It is aninteresting and ominous turn in the series.  It does require the viewer to follow along closely, but in the end, all the main characters find themselves at the center of the puzzle.']\n",

            " ['Just about the time that I thought just about every possible variant on the TV cop/detective/crime solving show had been explored by the creative geniuses who provide our nightly broadcast television ration of pap, piddle and trivia -whoa - here came a show that tickled our Sherlock Holmesian/forensic knowledge fancy.  Whoever would have thought that poking around with microscopes and spectrum analyzers and picking up little bits of fluff at a Los Vegas crime scene with a set of tweezers could be interesting? But yes, it was and has continued to be for going on eight seasons now and has given rise to a couple of variants set in New York and Miami. All three of the CSI iterations offer a distinct challenge to a viewer who possesses a decent ration of curiosity about puzzles and mysteries but a very, very low gross-out threshold. CSI season 7 mercifully let up a little on the really gross visualizations and focused a little more on the puzzles. Nothing I watched this season sent me gagging from the room, so either they let up or I have gotten a little more used to maggoty corpses.Three of the special features in this collection focus specifically on episodes which made season 7 stand a little apart. The first is  a `making of\\'  \"Built to Kill\" a two part episode set backstage at the astonishing Cirque d Soliel, another covers  the definitive stunt-casting of all time;  Roger Daltry playing five different guest parts in \"Living Legend\".  And a third extra feature focused on the hunt for the \"miniature\" killer, which continued intermittently all though the season. I found the \"Miniature Murders\" feature to be especially fascinating, as I had built many inch-to-a-foot scale model interiors and buildings. Having a series of perfectly replicated half-inch-to-a-foot murder scenes showing up within hours of a real, full-sized murder offered a puzzle to Grissom and his crew that lasted all season. Very obviously, it would have taken an artisan of miniatures days and weeks to build such a detailed replica, and the feature made it very clear what a challenge it was, even with the resources available to a television studio. Other extras include commentary tracks for seven episodes, and a tour of the real CSI-Las Vegas offices; which, astonishingly enough, are very much more cluttered and not nearly as plush-looking as the series sets.']\n",

It goes without saying that you won\\'t be bored anything or character in Season 7 of CSI as they continue to up their game and keep finding more interesting cases to tackle and underlying stories between the office as a whole.After 7 seasons one would think that CSI would be slipping up or become complacent about its longevity.

Each episode has a little something different to it whether its \"Lab Rats\" where the other workers in the CSI office take a front seat to try and help Grissom solve the mystery behind the miniature killer.  This is an ongoing arc throughout this Season and it requires all the characters help in piecing together exactly who\\'s doing this and better yet why.\"Living Doll\", it ends with a cliffhanger as Sarah has been kidnapped by the miniature killer leaving things wide open on what will actually happen to her will Grissom, Katherine and the others make it to her in time.Some of my favorite episodes from this include:\"Built to Kill, Part 1\"\"Fannysmackin\"\"Living Legend\"\"Lab Rats\"\"Living Doll\" the season ender with a big cliffhangerThe whole season is worth purchasing in any respect as in also includes Special Features-\"Inside Built to Kill\", \"Miniature Murders\", \"Who Are You?

Having said that ...Each season I keep saying the same thing, - this show keeps getting better and better. I feel this show always manages to stay fresh and interesting and I love it more and more with each new season. I can't wait for this release.The first episode in this season is Built To Kill where we are waiting to see more of what we found out in the last episode of season 6 - that Grisolm and Sara had gotten together. My favourite episode is Happenstance where identical twins have been seperately killed and the team try to work out whether the case is related or not. If you want a total recap of each episode then here it goes:Built To Kill 1 - Foul play is suspected when an apparent suicide victim still has the gun in his hand, and a flower delivery woman is found crushed to death in the middle of a Cirque du Soleil performance. (Look for a special appearance from John Mayer.Built To Kill 2 - Grisolm investigates the murder of a rock star, which is complicated by the discovery of a miniature replica of the crime scene at the house. And Catherine tries to determine if she was raped after waking up nude in a seedy hotel.Toe Tags - A group of dead bodies in the Las Vegas morgue get to know each other while CSI tries to solve the crimes that got them there.Fannysmackin' - (another favourite of mine) A gang of street thugs is beating and killing people all over the city. Greg witnesses one of the crimes taking place and becomes a beating victim himself.Double Cross - A lounge singer is found crucified inside a Catholic church, and the church's new pastor fails to disclose that he knows the victim from all the way back to high school.Burn Out - A pedophile arsonist maintains his innocence in the disappearance of two young boys, but he is also willing to help the investigation by giving Grissom insight on the potential kidnapper's mindset.Post Mortem - Greg has his day in court for running over and killing a street gang member right before his own beating, and a second crime scene replica is found--this time after the murder of an elderly woman.Happenstance - CSI investigates the deaths of estranged identical twins: one from a gunshot wound, and one from an apparent suicide. The two deaths do not appear to be related, but are they?Living Legend - (the only boring episode) The team searches for a link between a current string of murders in Las Vegas and a notorious mob boss who disappeared in the 1970s.Loco Motives - Gil finds a third miniature crime-scene replica at a murder site, and CSI tries to find a link between the three otherwise-unrelated murders.Leaving Las Vegas - Catherine tries to link an accused killer to a second similar crime in a small town after he is found not guilty in the first trial, and Gil announces that he is going on sabbatical.Sweet Jane - The C.S.I. team doesn't know what to make of their new member ( Liev Schreiber), who joins them in the hunt for a serial killer, active since the 1970's.Redrum - Keppler proposes that Catherine create a phony crime scene to help catch a murderer, and to keep it secret from the other investigators. However, Nick quickly figures out that something is fishy.Meet Market - The discovery of a badly burned corpse uncovers a plot to illegally harvest bones and tissues, and the death of a middle-aged wife appears to be connected to her relationship with a high-priced male companion.Law Of Gravity - When one Trenton cop is murdered in Las Vegas, a second threatens to expose Keppler's past if he doesn't make the case and the evidence go away.Monster In The Box - Grissom thinks the miniature killer is dead, until he receives another miniature crime scene. However, unlike the others, this one predicts a crime scene that hasn't happened yet.Fallen Idols - A star high school basketball player disappears, and the investigation reveals that he gave an STD to a couple of his classmates.Empty Eyes - Six showgirls who live together are murdered in their home, and Sara is distressed when the final victim dies in her arms. However, she may have left Sara a vital clue that could help her ultimately identify the killer.Big Shots - A death in a drive-by limo shooting and the dragging death of a young woman turn out to be related crimes, and Greg discovers that the brother of the young man he ran over may have been involved.Lab Rats - With Grissom out of his office and all of the detectives out in the field, Hodges and the lab other techs try to discover new clues in the miniature killer case.Ending Happy - A washed-up boxer is found dead at a nearby bordello. There are several suspects, motives, and signs of injury. But the medical examiner is having a hard time figuring out which blow was the actual cause of death.Leapin' Lizzards - CSI discovers that a woman may have been murdered, and her head mounted on a wall as a trophy, because the killer was convinced that she was actually a powerful alien reptile. (Quite a bizzare episode and a bit of a departure from what you're used to seeing on CSI).The Good, The Bad And The Dominatrix - After an unsuccessful attempt on Lady Heather's life, Sara discovers Gil's prior relationship with her. Meanwhile, Nick investigates the death of a woman apparently hit by a taxicab.Living Doll - The miniature killer is ready to strike again, and Sara will be the next victim. Will CSI stop her in time?Throughout the season you see the theme of the miniature killer. It started out slowly and built up speed toward the end. Because of the killer and what he/she has done to Sara, Grisolm ending up blurting out to the others about their relationship. At first the team aren't sure if they heard right or not, but it becomes apparent that they are a couple and that's almost as exciting as working out who's behind these miniatures.If you are a CSI fan, you are bound to love season 7. It truly gets better always and I already can't wait for season 8.\"]\n",

After all if the corrupt cop was going to kill his partner he would be unlikely to do it in Vegas when he\\'s from Trenton. However that\\'s not implausible and he was after all blackmailing Keppler. So  people do things all the time that don\\'t make any sense even bad cops. So even a strained episode of \"CSI\" is still top rate entertainment.Overall the series was at it\\'s peak during this season and the next.The ninth season is excellent too but long time viewers are without three of their favorite characters.  As many posters pointed out this is one of the entire series best seasons and that\\'s true enough because it remains a fascinating show and thankfully there\\'s no techno soundtrack like on later episodes of \"CSI New York\".

The season opens with Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara (Jorja Fox) keeping their relationship secret as a mystery unfolds regarding a killer who leaves behind exact, incredibly detailed, miniature replicas of the crime scene.  As the rest of the season unfolds, Greg (Eric Szmanda) finds himself in a predicament he never foresaw, Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) finds herself playing the role of victim, and when Grissom goes out of town, a shady transfered cop named Keppler (the excellent Liev Schreiber) arrives on the scene; culminating in one of the best storyarcs the series has ever seen.  As the season winds to a close, the CSI's close in on the miniature killer, and the season concludes with one of their lives in jeopardy, and the others desperate to make things right.  Undoubtedly one of the best seasons of the show in it's entire run, the original (and best) C.S.I. remains one of the best crime dramas to ever grace prime time network TV, and the seventh season is a prime example why.\"]\n",

I wouldn\\'t worry about any of that if while I were watching it I had enough emotional involvement to care if one of the characters died but after 3 seasons if a main character was killed off I\\'d just wonder how that would change the shows dynamics.One other thing that drive me a bit crazy is that the show acts like the FBI can\\'t even use the bathroom without \"Charlies\" help. I understand its a tool to show how vital he is but he gets 911 calls and guilt trips from his brother before it\\'s necessary, like at the very beginning of a case.So, while I recommend this show, especially for family viewing and believe it\\'s well above average, I still can\\'t say it\\'s great.']\n",

Upon watching them again, I see how they are also emotionally appealing and surprisingly sophisticated, both in their science and in the lack of \"feel good\" deus ex machina endings that mar so many otherwise excellent Star Trek stories.I think by far the best story of this lot is \"The Man Who was Never Born\", which exudes a kind of timeless anguish.  It still moves me to think of the deformed Landau, who was truly brilliant.  But the \"Architects of Fear\" is also wonderful, with the good man sacrificing himself in vain and communicating his love to his wife from his horribly altered form.  They are both tragedies with grand conceptions behind them, truly unique. \"The Galaxy Being\" and \"The Sixth Finger\" are also deeply affecting and believable in their way.  These are all timeless themes in hard sci-fi, done extremely well.There are some bad episodes too, but overall the good ones are worth the price of admission.  I do not see why some reviewers are angry at the format of splitting season 1 into 2 volumes - it doesn\\'t cost more.Warmly recommended as a piece of TV history that still stands on its own as outstanding hard scifi.']\n",

Sure the second season had some classic episodes (among them \"Solider\" and \"Demon with a Glass Hand\" which inspired James Cameron to come up with \"The Terminator\".

They haven\\'t been enhanced with any thing AND there are no extras. I\\'d average that out to 2 stars for this set.Don\\'t get me wrong--the first season was terrific for the most part. This set (like the first season set) features the moving \"The Man Who Was Never Born\" with Martin Landau as a scarred victim of a viral holocaust who is given the chance to go back in time and prevent the birth of the man who created his sterile world. Featuring a rich score by the late Domninic Frontiere (among his best), this was \"The Outer Limits\" as its best. Also we get \"The Galaxy Being\" with Cliff Roberson who unwittingly brings an alien creature he has been communicating with from a world made of anti-matter into ours causing destruction and death. David McCallum in \"The Sixth Finger\" about the results of an experiment to push humanity to evolve to the next level but how, in the process, we lose the essence of what makes us human.\"The Zanti Misfits\" like much of Stefano\\'s work provides a neat allegory about human nature.

A crime scene investigator from Miami who is an expert on blood. He also likes to seeking revenge on those criminals who escape the law by loopholes in the justice system. Believe me this is no CSI show!Created by novelist Jeff Lindsay, Hall and his supporting cast (including Lauren Velez, James Remar, Julie Benz, and Jennifer Carpenter)create an interesting portrait of man whose blood is dipped in both worlds. Hall's baby face showcases an evil side underneath his devilish killer smile. The show is an interesting character study as well as a great murder mystery.There is the  Ice Cream truck murderer who is stalking Dexter and leaving killer clues. The mystery unfolds in these 12 episodes and you will be intrigued by the last episode. This is like a good British televsion series, a full complete story unfolded in 12 parts.The extras on the fourth disk are  two episodes of Showtime's The Blotherhood (which is also available on DVD), audio commentary on the 12th episodes, and a true life crime story. Those of you with computer can read the first two chapters of the latest Dexter novel and a download of the Showtime show the Tutors (soon to be on DVD)Even without the extras, this is a five star killer show...its a bloody good time.

            " ['Dexter Morgan is good at his day job, that of a blood spatter analyst in Miami PD\\'s forensics unit. But he\\'s bloody brilliant at his other job, the one where he gets to murder. Whatever effed up sitch it was that caused Dexter\\'s amnesia regarding his early childhood, it\\'s left him dead inside, an empty shell, a calculating cold fish. He co-exists with something he calls a \"Dark Passenger,\" essentially this urge that compels him to kill and kill. Recognizing the predatory beast inside Dex, his ex-cop foster father, Harry (James Remar), took the boy under his wing, reoriented his twisted appetites to a more productive cause. He instilled in Dex an elaborate code of ethics, taught him to target only other serial killers. He taught Dexter how not to get caught, how to blend in. Dads are awesome. And Dexter has steadfastly abided by the Code of Harry. His kills have been righteous kills.This Showtime adaptation is based on Jeff Lindsay\\'s riveting series of books, and if you haven\\'t read them, well, what\\'s the hold up? Dexter Morgan is so emotionally detached he makes Dr. Temperance Brennan seem positively warm and cuddly. Social cues to which we effortlessly respond are baffling puzzles for him. Perversely, there is something innately likable about Dexter. Michael C. Hall plays him with stunning complexity. It helps that, like in BURN NOTICE, we\\'re privy to his inner musings. Dexter is often humorous and whimsical. The girlfriend (Julie Benz) he pretends to care for doesn\\'t suspect a thing. Even Dexter\\'s jittery, potty-mouthed cop sister, Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), doesn\\'t have an inkling.DEXTER THE FIRST SEASON hooks you in straight away as Dexter finds his bragging rights as Miami\\'s resident monster challenged by an innovative fellow serial killer whom the press eventually dubs the Ice Truck Killer. It\\'s an edgy cat-and-mouse game that would span the entire season and cause Dexter to ask serious questions of himself. The lovely twist is that Dexter accepts the Ice Truck Killer\\'s tauntings with glee, perhaps like calling to like. For Dexter, it\\'s an opportunity to play with someone just like him. Never mind that it\\'s readily apparent that this rival knows everything about Dexter Morgan. Dexter shrugs this off. He\\'s having fun.The Ice Truck Killer\\'s modus operandi is eye-catching. He drains his victims completely of their blood and he freezes the corpses, amputates their limbs to a precise measurement. It\\'s fun - and creepy - watching Dexter try to contain his excitement as each perfect frozen body part surfaces, each bit a gauntlet thrown in Dexter\\'s mug.Most each episode also features a \"serial killer of the week\" motif, some heinous repeat murderer targeted and eventually carved up by Dexter, and these lesser villains are required so that we don\\'t lose faith in Dex as a badasss dude, given his inability to track down the elusive Ice Truck Killer. It\\'s a pretty good supporting cast, too. It wasn\\'t long before I was keen into what these other characters were up to. Jennifer Carpenter is my second favorite actor on this show. She is one sexy, combustible, never-stop-cussing cop chick. But I do question her instincts. She\\'s Miami PD - an ex-Vice, newly minted Homicide Detective - and yet in all these years she hasn\\'t caught a whiff of her adopted brother\\'s true nature? And then she does something else which ends up absolutely mortifying. And then there\\'s Erik King whose angry, loose cannon character, Sgt. Doakes, is the only one who gets the heebie jeebies from Dexter. Doakes bullies Dexter so much, I sort of wish Dexter would just disregard the Code of Harry for once. Except that Dexter remains as cool as the other side of the pillow. He\\'s a monster who\\'s got his priorities straight. You need to not miss this show. It\\'s wicked funny, cleverly written, and terrifically acted (especially by Michael C. Hall). Rife with moral ambivalence, DEXTER rewards its audience with unexpected - and frequently unsettling - moments. And you\\'re hooked before you know it.The DVD set\\'s bonus features:- 2 Audio Commentaries by the Cast & Producers: \"Return to Sender\" (with Jennifer Carpenter, David Zayas, Lauren Velez, and Erik King) and \"Born Free\" (with producers Sara Coleton, Clyde Philips, & Daniel Cerone)- \"The Academy of Blood - A Killer Course\"- \"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation\" - feature on a real-life police investigation in 2001 with particulars on blood spatter analysis- 2 Free Episodes of Showtime\\'s Hit series BROTHERHOOD- A computer-compatible function which allows you to stream two episodes of THE TUDORS, to read the First 2 Chapters of Jeff Lindsay\\'s newest novel DEXTER IN THE DARK, and play the newest CSI Video Game \"CSI: HARD EVIDENCE\"- Cast Biographies']\n",

The Officer adopts the child and takes the opportunity to carefully ingrain in him that he is ONLY to kill others like him...serial killers....who have managed to slip through the system and remain free.  Dexter learns to be one of the best blood spatter experts at the police station.This is extraordinarily interesting as Dexter narrates his inner most thoughts, and we get to learn how a sociopath, with no empathy or understanding of how \"normal\" people feel, navigates through society mimicking how people behave.  That is fascinating.  The acting is dead-on and the writing is crisp and taught.  My ONLY issue with this series is the foul, gutter mouth of Dexter\\'s sister...it is so extreme that it feels like slaps in the face.Really good television.']\n",
            " [\"This concerns only the first season of this series and I know some of the things will not seem right to those who have watched the next seasons. But that is just the point. The first season has characteristics that will change later and the meaning will change too. I will keep within the very limits of that first season. What we gather from the first episodes is that this blood technician working for the Miami PD is the adopted son of a police officer. He was adopted at the age of four by this police officer because he had been traumatized by the killing of his mother with a chain saw by some drug dealers. At once the series insists on the fact that this trauma caused an irreversible damage in the psyche of the child who is fascinated by death and needs killing just like junkies need their drugs. He is addicted to inflicting death to other people. We will only learn quite late in this season who his real father was, after his death actually, so we will never know the man really. We will not be given in this season any detail about the death of the mother beyond what I have said. And all the detail that comes up now and then is always flashbacks in the memory of the child that Dexter was. Dexter recovers that memory little by little just like any child or even adult would do in the case of a traumatic event. His foster father just tried to bring this death impulse of his within some acceptable limits, within a certain code: you can kill but to survive hence you have to kill people who are just plain dirty (I sort of remember this is the code of Anne Rice's vampires). And that's what he has been taught and trained to do. First hide your impulse. Second pick the proper criminals. Third do it so professionally that you can never be suspected. This ideology then is very typical. You can survive any trauma if you know what you are, if you accept what you are and if you find out why you are what your are. When you finally know, then you are clear. The term comes from Hubbard but it is the one that is needed here. It may change later. This concept of clarity is doubled then with the Skinnerian concept of absolute determination of your whole being and future by the mould into which you have been cast in the very first years of your life. In this case, Dexter is a killer because of his trauma that happened when he was four, hence he will be a killer all his life. No one can change that. One can only teach the kid a code, a method, an art to do things along a certain ethical line and not to be caught. That is pessimistic but that is not the main interest of this first season. The main interest is that another serial killer, the Ice Truck Killer, though not being a copy cat, is obviously aiming at this Dexter. And his crimes that are very special in their style, method and delivery are there to titillate Dexter, to chase or bait Dexter into a trap or a corner. Little by little we will learn the connection between the two and that I won't reveal. In the end Dexter will have the upper hand and kill his competitor, along his own method, more or less.  The second interest of this series is how Dexter can keep his secret for himself in his own private life, hiding it from the women he is going along with, from his own sister (foster sister for sure but sister anyway), from his direct colleagues, from his department, etc. It is subtle and difficult and there the actor is doing quite a good job, though the series is more building the meaning with the environment of the character than with the acting of the actor. As usual in American series the actors are rather static and the stage director, the series director and the set designer are building around him or her a composed visual moving environment that builds the meaning of the expression or speech of the actor. Note in this case most of the discourse of the main actor is his own voice over the pictures. He is telling us a story and it is often a commentary of what we can see. The next and essential quality of this series is of course the real artistic and artful suspense that is built in each episode and in the twelve episodes of the season and that lets us absolutely breathless most of the time, even when we finally know who the Ice Truck Killer is, and then the suspense does not go down one iota. In other words this series is so far, first season only, Dionysian, quick, fast, dense, exhilarating, inebriating, intoxicating and many other things of that sort. In one word it is addictive and habit forming. You may, if you have ten hours and a half at your disposal watch the twelve episodes in one go and you will never be bored, tired, de-concentrated. Try it and you will like it I am sure.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID\"]\n",

The idea of Dexter being a sociopath is not exploited to its full potential, IMO.  Too much of the time he blends in so much you forget all about it, then you have to be reminded by forced voice overs and flashbacks.  This is a good DVD set though, I see lots of folks complaining about the transfer.  What can I say, don't spend 50 zillion bucks on your TV/Home theatre and you won't be so disappointed.  For 20 bones you get 12 doses of Dexter, AND two episodes of Brotherhood, and one of The Tudors if you have the time to screw around with the PC feature.

The TV version fleshes out the other characters, such as Rita. the girlfriend and the police lieutenant, La Guerta  and introduces a new character in the person of Esme. The book is an intense ride within Dexter\\'s mind with a focus on his relationship with his Dark Passenger. The details of his relationships with other humans are not as detailed as in the series.Having said this, I highly recommend both. It will be interesting to see how Showtime adapts the second novel.I think Showtime has done a great job of casting in this series. I remember Michael Hall from \"Six Feet Under\" and I think he makes a perfect Dexter.Also, CBS is now showing Showtime\\'s Dexter on Sunday evenings at 10 pm.

It is similar to the way the dark parts of paintings illuminate the light, each complimenting the other.

I have some very queasy thoughts about why a series this twisted is so popular, but I guess it's just another Clint-type revenge drama where psychopathic violence is justified by (a vaguely) moral imperative; we do need our foreign policy to start somewhere.Hall is even better here than in Six Feet Under, where he was superb. He carries Dexter effortlessly on his shoulders, but one can feel the amount of work and care he's put into this role. It's as impressive as Gandolfini's Tony Soprano, and that's saying a lot.

And then I started looking at two things. The first was my television watching schedule which has actually begun cutting into my DVD watching schedule (so little time, so much to watch). Then I looked at my shelving unit and noticed the number of TV series collections there. People are wrong. There is plenty good to watch on TV. And DEXTER is an example of it.For those who aren\\'t aware, DEXTER is a series on Showtime, so many of you might not have seen it. If that\\'s the case you\\'re in luck because the series has been released on DVD. While season two has just hit shelves in blu-ray format, the focus here is season one.Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is a forensics blood splatter expert for the Miami police department. His job is to help collect and understand evidence found at the scene of a crime that involves blood and blood splatter patterns. Oh, and on the side, Dexter is a serial killer.Stay with me here because he\\'s not a bad guy really. Well...then again maybe he is. After all he is a murderer multiple times over. The difference is that Dexter only kills bad guys. Dexter kills murderers, pedophiles, arsonists and the like that got off due to some technicality. But he always verifies that they were guilty before taking them out of the picture.Dexter\\'s foster father Harry (James Remar) was a police man who found Dexter at the scene of a crime before adopting him. Harry recognized the killing instinct found in Dexter at an early age so he helped him to channel that, to use rules that he established for Dexter, to get through life. And via Harry\\'s rules, Dexter now kills bad guys using his job as a means to find just the right victims.So there is the basic set up for the series. But it\\'s so much more than that, filled with layer upon layer of subtext and inner meaning that is revealed as the series progresses.Season one focuses first on letting us know who Dexter is and who the surrounding cast of characters involved with him are. First off is his sister Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), a seemingly spastic patrol officer dying to become a homicide detective. Deb\\'s enthusiasm for the job is off set by her self deprecating ways and the giddiness she exhibits for all things.At the stations there are two main characters who affect Dexter. The first is Lt. Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez) his direct supervisor who at times seems to have a personal interest in Dexter. A woman who\\'s made it where she is by hard work, she has a storyline of her own involving police office politics as the series progresses.The second is Sgt. James Doakes (Eric King), Dexter\\'s apparent nemesis. Doakes is a hard boiled cop from top to bottom, a no nonsense sort who wants answer and wants them now. Doakes is constantly badgering Dexter, offering everything from name calling to in your face attitude. One would think that eventually the two of them would reach a point where there wouldn\\'t be room for both of them in Miami. One would think.Along with these major players there is an assortment of cast members in the squad who round out the ensemble in the best way possible. And each gets enough screen time in season one to make them a character to care about. The interaction between them on a personal level comes into play as the layers of Dexter unravel.On the personal side, Dexter actually has a girlfriend. Normal on the outside, but not within. It seems Dexter has taken her as his girlfriend to help appear normal. It is through his thoughts (voice over into Dexter\\'s mind runs throughout the series) concerning her that he lets us know he is devoid of emotion, that he has no feelings. His involvement with her is purely as a means to offer him cover.Rita (Julie Bienz) is a battered wife, or at least she was. Dexter\\'s sister was on call when her ex was arrested. Paul, her ex, was a wife beater extreme and a drug user to boot. Now in prison, he gets release part way into season one and a subplot here involving him trying to reinsert himself into his family\\'s life crosses Dexter\\'s life as well.With characters and plot lines established, you would expect the series to kick off with Dexter showing what he can do. Instead, Dexter finds himself in a competition of sorts when a new serial killer hits Miami. And this killer is leaving calling cards that Dexter not only finds discomforting but amazing as well. He\\'s impressed with the style and artistic ability of the killer who leaves his victims in pieces and drained of blood.As each episode continues the tale, we find that this new killer referred to as the Ice Truck Killer (when it\\'s discovered that he uses one to haul victims from their murder location to where he leaves their bodies) knows something about Dexter. He leaves small clues at first for Dexter to find. Eventually he leaves Polaroid\\'s of Dexter\\'s past as well. It seems that the perfect serial killer is being stalked by his own serial killer.Season one not only defines who the character of Dexter is it offers the world he lives in and tosses in his biggest match to boot. How Dexter became who he is and what influences him is told in flashback. His motivations are shown by the end of this season as is the identity of the Ice Truck Killer. But will that change who Dexter is? Doubtful since season four begins soon.What makes this show so unique is that it combines one of the most frightening characters one can imagine, a soul less who cares serial killer, with one of the wittiest funny line spouting people seen on TV. Dexter tosses off subtle one liners non-stop and each one offers a glimpse behind the mask and a laugh as well.But the amazing thing is that not only do we find ourselves repulsed and attracted to the same character, we find in the writing that there is more to him than is even he realizes. The character of Dexter may think he possesses no emotions whatsoever but his emotions run deeper than he realizes. And it seems as though his journey of self revelation may be what\\'s driving the series forward in later seasons.Also Dexter offers something that many of us would never want to admit we seek. An avenging angel out there doing what so many would love to know is going on but at the same time turn their head and condemn on the outside. Like Jack Bauer of \"24\", a hero who uses tactics we claim to hate while hoping someone like him exists to protect us, Dexter is the privately admired solution for those who feel that the worst of criminals are let lose on technicalities. We would fear someone like Dexter while at the same time would love to see someone who doesn\\'t let the bad guy get away with murder. Even though this is what Dexter does, murder.There is no way to offer up in this short space just what it is that Dexter is about. Police procedural. Police politics. Serial killer. Murder mystery. Family complexities. Killing tutorial. Hilarious dark comedy. All are a part of Dexter and all come together in a fantastic package.If you\\'re not afraid to try something a little different, then you need to give Dexter a try. I know the season one set I watch belonged to my son. After watching I intend to get a copy of my own. And to continue with it down the line. I\\'m already hard at work watching season two on blu-ray to write about. Unusual, quirky, off beat, scary, normal...all are words that define Dexter. And yet none can explain what this series is all about. Watch and see.']\n",

            " ['Wow! I finally watched my very first episode of \"Dexter\" last weekend, and I ended up finishing Season 1 in its entirety within a few days. This is an amazing show about Dexter (Michael C. Hall), a Miami-based forensics experts who also happens to be a serial killer. However, Dexter is a NICE serial killer in that he has a strict moral code that he always adheres to: He only kills people who are violent criminals themselves and deserve to be punished. The first season of \"Dexter\" revolves around another serial killer that\\'s been terrorizing the state of Florida. The Ice Truck Killer has a nasty habit of murdering prostitutes, cutting them up into pieces, and arranging their bodies artfully in very public places. Dexter works with members of the police department, including his adopted sister, Deb (Jennifer Carter), to find the killer. However, Dexter can\\'t help being fascinated by the Ice Truck Killer\\'s meticulous technique. He soon begins communicating with the killer, who seems to have an uncanny connection to Dexter and starts using his murders to trigger painful, repressed memories from Dexter\\'s past.I became hooked on this show very quickly. Hall is amazing as Dexter, who is probably one of the most complex characters in television history. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Carter, Erik King as Sergeant Doakes (the only person who suspects Dexter of any wrongdoing), and James Remar, who portrays Dexter\\'s father in flashbacks. I\\'m not particularly fond of Rita\\'s character (portrayed by Julie Benz). She\\'s incredibly wishy-washy, but I can definitely see why Dexter was drawn to someone with her personality. I also think the whole Ice Truck Killer identity revelation, intriguing as it was, could have been a bit less obvious. (I figured out his real identity and true connection to Dexter right away, so either the story was a bit too predictable or I am just incredibly brilliant.)Overall, though, \"Dexter\" is a very unique and compelling show. I have no idea how the program will manage to surpass its first season, but I can\\'t wait to find out.']\n",
            " [\"I had never seen Dexter before not having showtime but after seeing the show on a regular station I was hooked and ordered the first season,loved it and am waiting for the second season which I ordered to ship. It's definitely addictive. The show is well written you actually like this serial killer\"]\n",
            " [\"Sometimes I find connections to Hollywood in the strangest places.  In the case of Dexter, it was at my day job. Now my office job is not normally the place one associates with a show like Dexter, but it turns out that the sister of the guy I worked with worked on the show. The fact that the show is on Showtime and thus can portray gore and violence as appropriate to the medium (like HBO's Rome, for example) piqued my curiosity. Unfortunately, it took me over a year to actually view season one.  I'm sorry I waited so long.I've done enough research on serial killers (and their fictional cousin, slashers) to know that they're easy to mess up.  And an entire season about a serial killer from the serial killer's perspective is fraught with peril. Fortunately, Dexter hits all the right notes to keep an audience engaged for the entire season.Dexter Mogran (Michael C. Hall) is a serial killer with a cause.  His father, Harry (James Remar) recognized his adopted son's homicidal tendencies and trained him to stalk the most despicable of prey.  These were the lowest of the low, the scum that Harry in his job as a cop saw frequently escape justice.  Dexter became a Final Solution of sorts, eliminating people neatly and efficiently while at the same time fulfilling insatiable desire for bloodshed.  Literally.In his day job, Dexter is a blood spatter analyst.  He works side-by-side with his adopted sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), probably the most annoying character in the show.  And yet, she's annoying on purpose - her frail, waif-like reactions to men and the rigors of her job make her alternately pathetic and vulnerable, feral and misguided.  In short, she needs Dexter's calm, creepy presence. Rounding out the cast is career-climbing Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez), coworkers Angel Batista (David Zayas) and Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee, formerly of the show Chuck) and my favorite character, foul-mouthed Sergeant James Doakes (Erik King).  Doakes is the only person who sees Dexter for what he is, but he can't prove it.Dexter feigns a personal life as well.  He has a girlfriend, Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), whose last relationship was so emotionally scarring that she fears intimacy, which suits Dexter just fine.  Indeed, all of Dexter's life is an act, from the jokes he cracks to the donuts he brings to the pleasantries he exchanges with Rita.  He's a monster masquerading as a person, and the only reason it's not more obvious is because everyone else has more pressing problems.Dexter's job puts him in a unique position to both appreciate the art of the kill and find new victims. Despite his penchant for murdering his victims, Dexter's murders are relatively clean - he drains his victims of blood, hacks the pieces up, and tosses them into the ocean.  And so it goes: find some sleazeball who escaped justice, kidnap him or her, murder, dump the body, repeat. Until one day, another serial killer who seems to know intimate details about Dexter's past begins sending messages through his own unique style of doll-like murders.The ending of season one won't be a shock to observant viewers.  It's not the actual ending that matters but the journey getting there. Dexter's narration is amusing and wry, his cadence just off enough that he comes across as disturbed yet functional. Surprisingly, the show isn't very gory at all.  Dexter would probably be less sympathetic if we were subjected to every grisly detail.  In fact, by cutting away from the most gruesome scenes, Dexter has to remind us that he's one of the bad guys - the Code of Harry is as much the anti-hero's code that we see in a multitude of other crime-fighting shows.  It's a credit to the writers that Dexter is both a monstrous, damaged human being and yet still human.Can't wait for season two!\"]\n",

            " [\"Dexter has finally made his Blu-Ray debut, and the glossy, well-made series looks wonderful in the format.  Besides some relatively small BD-Live features (including seeing the first episode the third season), there really isn't anything here that wasn't on the standard-def version of the Complete First Season, but for Blu-Ray owners who haven't taken the plunge into Dexter's world, this is definitely worth checking out.  Below is my original review for first season.The interesting concept of this Showtime series makes it reason enough to check it out.  Michael C. Hall (Six Feet Under) plays the title character, who works in forensics for the Florida police by day, and is a serial killer at night. Because of his job and upbringing by a police officer foster father (James Remar), Dexter knows how to cover his tracks while wearing his mask of humanity by day.  Slowly though, things start to take a turn when another serial killer with connections to Dexter's own mysterious past rears his head, and soon enough our title character is caught in a bloody game of cat and mouse.  What makes Dexter so good is the approach taken to the theme of the series by the creators and Hall himself.  What could have easily flopped and failed miserably instead evolves episode by episode as we attempt to see what makes Dexter tick.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well to say the least. Julie Benz (the vampiric Darla from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) is superb as Rita: Dexter's rape victim girlfriend whom he keeps around so he doesn't have to bother with sex, HBO's Oz veterans Lauren Velez and David Zayas as fellow cops, and hottie Jennifer Carpenter (whom Hall has recently married, seriously) as Dexter's sister.  Not since Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer has there been an interesting and above all chilling glimpse into the mind of a madman that walks among us.  Spectacular, and definitely worth picking up even if you never caught the show on Showtime during it's first season run.\"]\n",

It took a couple of episodes for me to warm up to the character, but I did.I soon found myself rooting for a serial-killer who works for the cops which, to me anyway, means the writing is pretty good. The setting of post-Miami-Vice Miami is a visually interesting backdrop - although a little too much at times.

Other times, it's about a man who has no feelings but shows emotions like anger, frustration and fear. Oh, and there's the relationship between the main character and his damaged girlfriend. Who he feels is as damaged as he is. Now, I do hope these are not considered spoilers, as they are the central focus of the series it seems. There are more things going on in the series, such as his past relationship with his foster father, he relationship with his foster sister, his relationship with his coworkers etc. At this time, I can see the character developing into a very interesting but bizarre person. And of course the series will follow suit. We hope. After all, I have 6 seasons to watch. Can I recommend this series, sort of. I am not quite certain it is for everyone. It's growing on me though.

            " ['I guess my biggest complaint about DEXTER is that it isn\\'t nasty ENOUGH.  The premise if phenomenal...Dexter is a blood-spatter expert investigating murders by day and a murdered of killers by night.  By channeling his impulses to kill in a \"helpful\" way...he is actually a hero.  I know, I know, anyone who kills is bad...but seriously, the people Dexter knocks off are mostly brutal serial-killers themselves...killers who knock off children and other innocents.  Dexter is doing the world a favor.  And that\\'s the problem...he is so meticulous in who he kills that his dark side is really never more than a naughty wink.  There\\'s no real ethical dilemma for the viewer in rooting for Dexter.But don\\'t get me wrong...the show is a blast nonetheless.  From it\\'s super-saturated Florida colors, to its sly & witty narration, the show is top-notch and very entertaining.  Michael C. Hall is perfect as DEXTER.  While his performance isn\\'t exactly a tour-de-force of evil (like Anthony Hopkins in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, for example)...it is a lovely, inventive performance.  He brings nuance to the role of a guy who has to fake smiling...and because we know he\\'s faking, we\\'re kinda in on the joke.  We can be \"amused\" along with Dexter at his ability to fool most of society into liking him.The only true \"dark side\" to Dexter is his inability to love.  He has a girlfriend, but only to help himself look normal.  He is very good to her and her kids, and the poor girl (damaged from a previous, abusive marriage) just adores Dexter in return.  But he doesn\\'t really have feelings for her, and this colors all their scenes together.  This is the ethical quandary that I wish Dexter\\'s killings also had.The other thing I really like about the show are the flashbacks, showing Dexter being raised and groomed for his work by a very understanding foster father, who happens to be a cop.  James Remar plays this part so well...it\\'s probably the best role this long-time character actor has ever had.  It\\'s a small part, but he brings great strength to it.  And great love and concern for Dexter.  You always hear that parents will do ANYTHING to protect their kids...Remar\\'s character is the ultimate example of this.Also, the opening credits of the show are AWESOME!!  Creepy and clever.So, while the show, to me, isn\\'t perfect (I would prefer it a little darker), it is still HUGELY entertaining, well-acted by its lead and well-filmed for a relatively low budget.  If it sounds like your cup of tea, I think you\\'ll like it a lot.  If the basic premise turns you off...then don\\'t even bother watching!']\n",

            " [\"A Showtime production, Dexter is an anomaly.  It is a brilliantly written, intriguing, and totally engrossing series, that is seldom predictable.  Besides a compelling storyline, and characters that seem real, what makes the series even more unique, is that the protagonist, Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a blood spatter expert for the Miami police, is a cold blooded murderer.Hall's unusual role is the key to the series, and his performance is a riveting, and captivating character study, that makes Dexter a very hard show to turn away from.  Morgan is guided by the `Code of Harry'.  Harry (James Remar) was Dexter's adoptive father, an ex-cop who recognized that his traumatized son, had homicidal tendencies.  To help him survive, Harry trained Dexter to channel his desire to kill in a 'positive' direction, by instilling the directive to kill only those who truly deserve to die.  This twisted morality is quite bizarre, and makes for fascinating viewing, as Dexter kills ceremoniously.Presumably to contain any spilled blood, plastic sheeting is typically spread all around the area, and Dexter himself is also covered with plastic sheeting.  Victims are taped down naked to a table top face up, helpless and unable to move.  After drawing a blood sample for his collection, Dexter gets to work.  The dead body is chopped into pieces, and the remains placed in trash bags.  Few of the grisly details are actually shown, but the presentation is still pretty chilling.  The series has a wicked sense of humor, as Dexter discusses his thoughts through narration, as he nonchalantly goes about his business, which includes murder.  Harry is dead, but appears frequently, in flashbacks.  Harry's biological daughter Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), also works for the Miami PD in homicide.  She is eager, enthusiastic, loves to swear, and has a problem with authority.The twelve episodes play like a chapters in a book.  Unlike most weekly series, the format does not always involve solving a particular case within the episode.  Instead, the story unfolds broadly and more naturally, with information about Dexter and his past, coming in small bits.  Dexter is dealing with coming to terms with his emotions, or lack thereof, and watching how this affects the evolution of his relationship with his girlfriend Rita (Julie Benz), is fascinating.  Benz's performance is pretty amazing, playing an abused woman trying to start a new relationship.The central underlying story concerns a serial killer known as `Ice Truck Killer', who specializes in neatly slicing up his victim's bodies into bloodless pieces.  The whole concept is diabolically macabre, and well executed.  The killer has taken a special interest in Dexter, and tension and suspense grows more intense, after the killer's identity is revealed with a few episodes left to go.  The killer has an elaborate plan, though he is forced to improvise when the pursuit begins to close in.  As Dexter begins to recall the horrific circumstances surrounding his mother's death, the killer makes his play.  The writing is outstanding, and keeps you off balance.  Approaching the conclusion, things get a little shaky in the turn, but control is reacquired, and Dexter finishes wildly and dramatically, with a stylistic flourish that does not cheat the viewer.Dexter is refreshingly different from most forensic procedurals.  Although dealing with violence and death, there isn't a lot of fighting, shootouts, or chases.  The focus is on character and story development.  While there are things that go over the top, or are illogical, unlike programs like the CSI franchise, the level of drama isn't routinely pumped up by threats, flashy violence, condescending dialog, or music.  The police in Dexter work `normally', with no overly dramatic background music, while routine tasks like, processing the crime scene, performing tests, or analyzing evidence take place.  The level of acting by almost everyone involved is excellent, from the minor characters to the leads.  The writing is not perfect, but the characters and their dialog, are mostly credible, showing the audience some respect.  There are no long winded pretentious speeches sprouting psychobabble, phony overdramatic situations, and characters trying to top each other, or engaging in supercop behavior.  Criminal Minds or CSI Miami, this is not.The series is far from perfect, and doesn't escape being ridiculous.  While a darkened room, draped with plastic sheeting, with a naked victim tapped down helpless, is a terrifying scene, it makes little sense, unless Dexter has giant rolls of plastic sheeting, and maybe a case of packing tape in his car.  The time it would take to actually prepare the scene, and put up all that sheeting would be ridiculous.  Tape and plastic sheeting are excellent for retaining evidence like fingerprints, would have to be destroyed.  Dexter disposes a couple of bags of body parts per kill, but what happens to all that tape and plastic sheeting?  Over the course of the season, Dexter takes chances, makes mistakes, and has several close calls, and is clearly under suspicion, at the conclusion, setting the stage for the next season.One of the few negatives is the lack of subtitles, and the inappropriateness of the extras.  Two episodes have commentary tracks, but some of the other bonus materials, are not directly related to the series.  The mini-documentary Witnessed in Blood, covers the forensics for an unrelated criminal case.  And two episodes of Showtime's series Brotherhood are included, presumably as an attempt to promote that series.  More material specifically relevant to Dexter, would certainly have been preferred.  Otherwise, needless to say, the series is highly recommended to fans of the forensic crime genre.\"]\n",

This is not a defense of Dex, just a clarification.What makes him even more complex is that he did not suffer abuse at the hands of his loving foster parents; he maintains a good relationship with his sister, a cop; he works as a forensic examiner for the police; he fakes emotions as best he can with  his girlfriend and her kids; and feels nothing at all, most of the time, unless it's a sense that he must get rid of someone.Michael C.

To be sure many of these are minor points but they do contribute to the enjoyment of the show if handled well.The special features are an improvement over some previous Showtime series but far from perfect. We get two episodes of the excellent Showtime drama \"Brotherhood\". We also get \"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation\" a very good featurette that focuses on splatter analysis and what it reveals about a murder. It ties in to \"Dexter\" because that\\'s what Dexter does for a living on the show and it also helps him to break a number of cases. We also get a commentary track that I haven\\'t listened to yet as well as an online link to watch two episodes of the new Showtime series \"The Tudors\" and a pdf file with the first two chapters of the new Dexter novel. I suspect that \"The Academy of Blood: A Killer Course\" is along with the DEXTER novel excerpt buried in the DVD-Rom portion of the disc. You won\\'t be able to watch it or access it on a regular DVD player which is just plain sloppy as this isn\\'t indicated on the package.We also get biographies for the actors. While the extras here (including two commentary tracks on the set are very good, the show could have used more commentary tracks and the involvement of star Michael C. Hall on at least one of them. Also, the special features really need to be more clearly indicated as to whether they are DVD accessible, PC accessible and where you might find them on the disc.Minor Plot Spoilers:Dexter\\'s father a police officer recognized early on his son\\'s proclivities and tried to give him moral guidence and boundaries so that he can function in our world but, more importantly, use his \"skills\" to hunt down those that prey on others.Dexter is conflicted--he knows that he\\'s not normal and he also knows he doesn\\'t fit in (he has difficulty with emotions having to fake his way through it). He also recognizes what he is and how his father tried to shape him into something \"better\".When he goes toe-to-toe with the Ice Truck Murderer and tries to track down this nasty serial killer he gets a glimpse into his own soul but also recognizes that unlike his evil doppleganger he can choose his actions and not just act on his instincts.END OF PLOT SPOILERS:Overall, Dexter is a terrific show. The second season has also gotten off to a bold start. The first season used the novel DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER as a starting point. For the second season the writers/producers have chosen to depart from the novels which should make for an interesting move. This is a solid set that could be improved with future seasons.']\n",
            " ['\"Dexter\" is built on an intriguing premise: a man with antisocial personality disorder experiences murderous impulses but lives by a code - he can only kill murderers.  Kind of a twisted play on Freud\\'s concept of sublimation.  The series didn\\'t initially appeal to me, but overall I\\'m pleased that I stuck with the first season.  Michael C. Hall plays the titular character, a forensic expert in blood splatter.  He works alongside a group of detectives assigned to some of most brutal Miami murders; one of these cops is Dexter\\'s adopted sister, Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter).  Dexter was adopted as a child by a Miami cop (the now deceased Harry Morgan) who recognized that Dexter was antisocial.  Instead of allowing Dexter to go down the path of juvenile delinquency (and inevitably murder), Harry developed a code for him - you can kill but only under certain circumstances.  Harry also encouraged Dexter to do things to make him seem normal, such as dating, to help him hide his true nature and go undetected.  Most episodes feature Dexter stalking a serial killer, with a season long plot involving Dexter\\'s fascination with the \"Ice Truck Killer.\"The series features excellent writing and direction, which helps make the somewhat unbelievable premise feel realistic.  The acting also is top-notch.  Hall does a nice job of making Dexter charming and likeable (so that we can believe that he can fit in at work and his relationships) while also adding a bit of edge through his lack of true emotion, superficial charm, and violent impulses.  We can sense that evil lurks just below the surface, kept in check only by his adherence to his code.  It\\'s a solid portrayal of an extreme case of antisocial personality disorder, and the series isn\\'t afraid to make its protagonist dark and somewhat frightening.  The supporting cast is also terrific, with C.S. Lee scoring as Vince Masuka, Dexter\\'s lascivious co-worker who is a walking sexual harassment case.  Likewise, Sgt. Doakes (Erik King) helps lighten the mood as the only person who seems to know that Dexter is not the good guy he portrays.  I also enjoy the work of two \"Oz\" veterans - Lauren Velez as Dexter\\'s complicated Lieutenant, and David Zayas as Detective Angel Batista (perhaps Dexter\\'s closest \"friend\").Although I enjoyed the show, there were a few things I disliked about the first season.  Debra\\'s insecurity is highly grating, and the actress gives a twitchy, affected performance.  Dexter\\'s flashbacks to his days with Harry become extremely repetitive and unrealistic after awhile.  The first few episodes were difficult to watch, and Dexter came across as quite brutal; I was ready to give up on the series after these shows, but the character became more \"human\" in subsequent episodes.  Finally, the last two episodes of the season, which focused on the Ice Truck Killer case, were overly melodramatic and lead to a rather unsatisfying ending.  Although I approached the series with some trepidation and found it flawed, there\\'s enough to like about the Season 1 that I plan on watching Season 2 on DVD.']\n",

The problem with this headset is that it is flashy and looks like a gaming headset. Trying it out at home my wife LOL'd when she saw me testing it out and said I looked like funny, with the bright glowing red LEDs on the side of my head. My 12-year old son thought it looked &#34;awesome&#34; and asked that I buy a pair for him.  That being said, I can't really take these headphones into the office for work. Now on to the quality....Buying a brand I never heard of before, I wasn't expecting the quality product that I received. The packaging and build quality are exceptional. You get a nice box, complete with high-quality printed manual, a poster, various stickers, and nice black storage case with metal clasped drawstring. The surround sound quality and effects are amazing. Also, I ordered the 5.1 version, but I received the 7.1 version. This version must be a new product, as the 5.1 drivers available on the Sentey website did not work with the 7.1 headphones, so I had to dig out my USB CDROM drive and use the supplied drivers CD to install the drivers and utilities. Overall excellent value and quality considering the price, but the aesthetics might not be suitable for a business environment.\"]\n",
            " ['This review is for the Harmoniq Pro GS-4840. I noticed reviews on amazon have been all bunched together on certain items and its not even for the exact model im looking at.My coworker pointed me to these headphones, id never even heard of the brand before then. I was impressed with them from the second I opened the amazon box. These headphones are packaged very nicely and include a carry case.Build quality is excellent for the price.They are very comfortable ( I have a large head) and have a long cable that let you sit back and relax.As far as sound quality goes, im gonna say that the EQ presets on the software are terrible. They make the bass \"echo\" and are pretty useless for music listening. After spending about an hour playing through my music and tweaking the EQ to my liking I am quite pleased with them. No these headphones probably wont compare to high end music dedicated headphones. But for $60 they cant be beat. Gaming and movies are awesome on these. I played BF4, titanfall and watched a couple movies / shows before writing this.These headphones have true surround sound and make gaming much more interactive. Ambient sounds and foot steps are heard clearly and when I get pumped full of lead with a shotgun at close range? I jump in my chair because it gets Loud when the sound is close to you! Lol speaking of Loud, these headphones are LOUD, I usually leave the PC volume at 40% or under and theyre still loud.These headphones also work with the PS4, I tested them and played with them on my playstation. You can change the audio output settings from the PS control just like the official headset. Only thing is that the inline controls do not work with the PS4, but thats not a big deal. The levels are fine and dont need tweaking when gaming with the PS4.Kudos to Sentey for making these awesome headphones at such a reasonable price. 2 of my friends have purchased them and are just as excited and pleased with them. I will definitely be checking out their other products.****UPDATE****I uninstalled the provided software from my computer that controls the EQ\\'s of this headset. It sounds even better now! (for my taste anyway)I wasn\\'t a big fan of the presets and the way the software makes the headphones sound. It sounded too \"Artifical\" or Digital if that makes sense.Music sounds much more natural to me now. Mids and Highs are clear and the Bass is nice, clean and deep. I recommend that you let your onboard or dedicated sound card control the sounds and EQ\\'s for this headset.']\n",

            " ['If you already own FIFA 14 on PS3, there are still good reasons to buy this game. First of all, Jamaica had a monumental breakdown in the last stage of Qualifying and now I can rewrite the story. This game features 202 International teams (if Im not mistaken) which is the largest roster of countries assembled. The game lets you play the world cup in whatever length you wish. You can play the final game, the knockout tournament, the group stages/tourney, or the full campaign of 4 years of Qualifying eventually leading up to the finale. There is also a re-vamp to the single player story, which allows you to go from a relative nobody, (competing with teammates for a spot before the next cut), to captaining your country on the grand stage. I recommend this game because the last time I got to play with Jamaica in a game was World Cup 98 and it feels good to hoist the gold for your country, especially if you hail from one that usually gets overlooked. I think many people around the world will buy this game for that reason and I think it will pay off in longevity. 2-3 years from now, no one will be playing FIFA 14, they will be playing FIFA 16-17, but I think this game will persist alongside.']\n",
            " [\"I love FIFA. And I have played every single FIFA ever since ps-one. The game plays great and I have no problems with it, functionality wise. But there are 2 major annoying aspects about this game.1) Crossing the ball into the box is horrible, not bad or not good enough for a FIFA game but it is actually a nightmare. When you try to cross the ball into the box and try to score with a header, who ever the crosser is (Di Maria or Antonio Valencia, two of the best crossers in the world) it's like they lose all of the strength in their legs and the cross is a poor and weak kick of the ball. It's a bit ridiculous that a defender sliding to take the ball has more strength to clear the ball onto the other side of the pitch and you can't put a descent cross into the box.2) 97% of shots on goal are blocked by a defensive player. Which makes it amazingly hard to score goals. I am a pro in FIFA games but this one gets a bit annoying when you have a clear shot on goal and there always seems to be a defender that gets there just on time (a split second before you shoot) to deflect your shot, which is, pretty unrealistic in my point of view.But other than that, the game is great. Amazing features and the graphics are better than the normal FIFA 14. I recommend this game 100%. But keep in mind that it is the hardest FIFA game EVEEER.\"]\n",

The problem is when passing sometimes the man who is supposed  to receive the ball at the pass doesn't receive the ball it lets the ball pass him by there also been times when he jumps and let the ball pass him by on purpose and the opposite team gets  the ball.  It gets frustrating when it happens all the time.  when your own team catches the ball its no problem but when the opponent gets it,  I scream my head  off especially after a clean pass meaning there is no opponent near by or other team player that's  in the way of the pass.  Its a close, near, clean pass which I can not figure why it does this.  I played FIFA2013 and it doesn't do that unless its a long pass and there is another team player near by and its a better play but always to another team mate not to the opponent.

            " [\"I look forward to the World Cup games every four years since the 2006 version got me hooked.  My favorite squads have failed to make the cut, again but I have the old US team to fall back on and they are looking promising especially in the game.  The drawbacks here are that some of the commentary lines are old and have a poor audio quality to them and the crowd reactions haven't changed much except for their attire.  As far as the gameplay goes we are getting a smoother version of FIFA 14 with its skill enhancing mini games.  The controls are terrific if you play with a world class player, if you tackle the game with lesser skilled players the controls reflect that.  I could go on and on but at 15 plus hours in through several of the modes (Captain your Country/ Road to the World Cup and Story of Qualifying scenarios) I am hooked as my sore thumbs can attest.  The offsides being only on or off is the biggest problem with this title and takes away from the realism.  The other penalties are forgiving but the offsides will drive you nuts with the bad/close calls.  Players react like their real life counterparts and these games do a great job of reflecting the pageantry and uniqueness of the WC overall.  I only rented this to make sure it was as good as 2010 (it isn't) and I think I expected slightly more graphically (looks a little jaggy at 720p) but the game keeps me coming back and will throughout the summer as EA hopefully adds more free DLC content to the Story of Qualifying with Story of Playoffs, Story of Finals scenarios.\"]\n",
            " ['I own every EA FIFA World Cup title since World Cup \\'98 and have looked forward to the EA Games quadrennial release ever since. I purchased 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil right in the middle of the actual World Cup and unfortunately so far I am severely disappointed with the product EA has released.--------------------GAMEPLAY & GRAPHICS:Before I get into that though, you should know a few more things about this game. If you\\'ve played FIFA 2014 then you\\'ll likely be very familiar with 2014 World Cup. This game borrows all major gameplay elements directly from FIFA 2014. Personally I really enjoyed FIFA 2014 though based on many reviews I\\'ve read that titles reception was quite mixed.The major element of change for 2014 World Cup is of course the venue and the emphasis on national teams over club teams. EA has always done a good job with capturing the spirit of the world cup and the spectacle that surrounds each game. That remains intact in 2014 FIFA World Cup. Each game features a full introduction as you\\'d expect in a real World Cup game - including the players marching out onto the field, the playing of national anthems, etc. Big games (and the final) feature team and player celebrations, fireworks, confetti and all the celebratory aspects surrounding the biggest spectacle in sports. All is well in this regard of the game.Many reviews have commented on how much more difficult 2014 World Cup is than the standard FIFA 2014 game. I think that there is definitely a higher degree of difficulty but it\\'s not too bad. I play both games on the \"Professional\" setting and I\\'ve been able to adapt quite well to 2014 World Cup\\'s extra bit of difficulty. I\\'ve written off the spike in difficulty as just a matter of course - you are after all supposed to be playing at the highest level soccer has to offer.Graphics are a considerable improvement over the last World Cup game (2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa) and again are taken almost directly from FIFA 2014. That\\'s not a bad thing at all as the graphics are actually quite nice. Player models move quite well and look very close to their real-world counterparts. The extra sheen of celebration and the bright colors of the Brazilian theme add a welcome addition to FIFA 2014\\'s somewhat toned-down look.--------------------THE PROBLEMS:My main issue with this game are the myriad of problems that it shipped with and to this day haven\\'t been addressed. EA has taken a lot of flak from gamers and to be honest it\\'s easy to see why.The first problem I noticed shortly after starting my first World Cup (at the group stage). I was prompted by the game to make my 23-man roster and noticed some strange problems. The first issue is that some players aren\\'t selectable. Meaning that you can\\'t rotate them out of your team for another player in the reserves. This is apparently totally random as I\\'ve tried many different times with different teams using a different save file. That really won\\'t matter though because even the players who you can rotate will ultimately be changed by the game after making your selections. For example after swapping in a few key players in my Spanish team I saved and moved onto my first match against the Netherlands and immediately noticed huge gaps in my team. No Iniesta, Villa, Silva (even though they were clearly listed in my 23-man roster) and in their place were players that I didn\\'t call up. Again, I\\'ve tested and confirmed this exact issue with different teams using different save files.More problems are located with the online element. Connecting is the biggest hurdle as EAs servers seem to be frequently offline. When you do get on matches are pretty inconsistent. Some matches seem to go well while others are a lagging mess or worse simply disconnect.After buying the game I jumped on EA\\'s forum to see if there was a fix or if I was doing anything wrong and stumbled onto a forum full of people having the exact same issues. These issues have been reported since the launch of the title and are still not fixed (going on 3 full months) with the end of the World Cup looming in a few days as writing this review.--------------------CONCLUSION:EA does it again! They ship a game to meet a deadline instead of shipping a quality product. The game is broken and major elements are totally unusable. This company deserves the hate it gets. Do yourself a favor and confirm that these issues are fixed prior to buying this game or skip it altogether. Not recommended!']\n",

Your family believes you are dead, but you wake up in another world, filled with strange creatures, darkness and monsters. And so - you begin to explore.

I can honestly say that this game is one of my favorites.Note: As for Uplay, I have had no issues logging on or using the platform. It's very simple, I use the same login as other sites (preventing the problem of used names), and it works very smoothly. I haven't used it for other games, but for this one, it's well worth it.\"]\n",
            " [\"This is a shorter RPG that is perfect for people with a backlog that wish they could play more RPG's but cannot devote 70+ hours to them. It's also priced reasonably well with what you get.The game features a turn based time attack combat system similar to older RPG's such as Grandia or FF. The main playing field is a basic platformer where you can jump, fly and manipulate certain objects in the world. The graphics, sound effects and music are all top notch. Everything is rather original along with the rhyming dialog and cooky fairy tale-like characters you encounter.Some of the features include newgame+ which is available after you beat the game, this allows you to play through the game again with most things transferring over and the difficulty bumped a little higher. Another bonus is a co-op feature where another player (like a significant other) can control the small firefly companion which follows the protagonist on her quest.Overall this game is definitely worth the price and its an RPG that perfectly fits in with the rest of gamers huge backlog of games. Easily playable even in between bigger retail games and casually with a friend.Definitely recommend this.\"]\n",

I kind of get the sense of the story but the dialogue is all in rhymes which are not clever or entertaining, the characters are all bleh boring. What makes up for it is the very fun battle system, similar to grandia with a bar that tells you which character goes next, you can time your attacks to interrupt enemies and knock them back, if you do it well enough you can win a battle by just interrupting enemies and never get damage done. The game is not real deep, in that the many of the characters feel just like the others, except for Aurora the main character and Finn your mage they are pretty similar in abilities etc. Despite it's flaws I do like this game, and for $15 definitely worth it, and if they made a sequel (with a new writer) I'd buy it. If I could give it 3.5 stars that would be perfect but I think it's closer to a 4 star game then a 3 star game.\"]\n",
            " [\"**** This review is for the PS3 version, but since Amazon is selling only the PC--and the entire game content/design/etc. is the same across platforms, I think it's fair to review it here ****GRAPHICS & TECHNICALI downloaded the demo to this because I loved how it looked, though I knew nothing else about it. The demo covers game play in chapter 4 (there are 10 total). I was immediately struck by how pretty this game is. The game remains very nice to look at throughout, without frame rate stutters. Technically, I had no glitches at all with the game, in fact, and its load times are also unusually short.STORYAll character dialogue is in the form of rhymes. These are fairly cute and didn't wear on me as some others have found. The story itself is at times convoluted. It's a pretty standard fairy tale framework, so quite accessible, but nothing really remarkable.GAMEPLAY & DIFFICULTYThis is an RPG with a party of characters (up to around 6 at the end). There is no economy, and little to do besides flying around looking for chests, jewels, enemies to fight. Inventory is filled entirely by finishing fights and finding items in the world. Many people, myself included, will thus be inclined to hoard their potions and find themselves at the end of the game flush with them, having grown used to getting through fights without relying too much on items.The only crafting is of jewels (called oculi). There is a tip in the crafting section on recipes but I recommend looking online right off the bat for some more, else you'll miss some of the available gem types.Characters level aggressively (mine were in the high 40's by game-end), with skills that can be distributed into skills such as magic-oriented or combat-oriented.TACTICSThe game has Normal and Hard difficulties. I played on hard and recommend that. There are some fights that are difficult, but once the correct tactic is determined there are only a handful of fights that really require a few attempts (and dying is no big deal--just start the area again). Combat is turn-based and quite in depth. I play very few turn based games but others seem to consider this a top tier effort to it. Swapping in and out characters and using the firefly during fights to slow enemies are nice touches.I should add that in classic grind-like RPG style it's possible to buff your characters up by repeating enemy fights. You could either save then restart and it will refresh the enemies, or willfully die and it will refresh them (without you losing what you gained since last fight). This is optional. I spend no more than an hour of the game actively repeating a section and that was only to tip my skills up a few points to get where I wanted, but if you're into the semi-mindless grinding you could certainly do it.I finished this in ~12ish hours, I'd estimate.-----I generally prefer a bit more grit and gore in my games than playing as a princess, but for the purchase price of $15-20 this is a solid purchase.\"]\n",

The presets on the beaches are compromised because the audio signals are or can be manipulated by this adapter. So the time you spent setting up and tuning your in game audio to sound perfect, pressing the top or bottom left button changes the levels so your audio is different. You can easily change it back by pressing the opposite of what you pressed but its annoying because you shouldn't have to. The update that is required screws up your controller and causes intermittent delays from button presses to command execution on screen. If you play FPS games like ghosts or BF4, have fun with that. My advice is wait for a third party device or wire your chat headsets cable to a stereo plug. I did that and it works like a champ despite looking ghetto.

            " [\"I purchased one of these last week from a local retailer, as supplies were very limited everywhere.  I was mostly curious about what it could actually do, as TB and MS hinted that this was the killer accessory for third-party headphone integration, but no one was explicit about what it was capable of.  So, after playing with it for a week, I can tell you a couple things:1) IT is sold and marketed as an adapter for the 2.5mm chat cable used by most aftermarket gaming headsets to support chat.  The device actually contains a 2.5mm-3.5mm adapter for that purpose.  You can plug this into your XB1 controller and plug your old headphones' chat cable in to support voice communication on the XB1. You can also use your existing 2.5mm headset.2)It requires that your controller's firmware be updated through a simple process using a MicroUSB cable (included) Plug it in, plug something into it, and a prompt will appear to walk you through the process.  Very easy, takes about 1-2 minutes per controller.3)It DOES support game audio on certain non-gaming headphones.  From what I can tell, it works on CTIA-compliant mobile-device-compatible headphones.  Those are usually the ones with an inline mic, designed for cellphones, etc.  I use my Turtle Beach M5Ti and they are perfect.  Cable length is just right, mic for chat and game audio for everything else.4)Audio is being pushed over the same communication channel as the controller and chat, and I have seen a couple times where audio stutters, drops out, and then the controller disconnects and reconnects, so I'm unsure as to whether it is an interference or battery issue.I played a couple hours of Titanfall and watched some video.  With the TV muted.  Through the headphones plugged into the controller.  Definitely recommend.UPDATE:  Was able to use regular stereo headphones for game audio with no issues.  So... best accessory ever.\"]\n",

In order to hear the other people in my party, I had to turn down the volume in the game, which meant that I couldn't here certain things going on in the background.  You would think that Microsoft would have worked out a better system for integrating people's headsets before launch.

            " [\"I purchased this the day it came out from the blue store with the big yellow sign. Cost was twenty five bucks. It came with the controls, a 3.5mm to 2.5mm cord adapter, and the USB adapter to allow the controller update. Contrary to at least one review, your headset does NOT need an update. It is the controller that needs an update. this process took roughly 2-3 minutes start to finish.I intended to use this with my old Turtle Beach X-31 headset. I have the game sound wired through the audio out jacks from the television so I can control the game volume via my headset volume dial. As there were no clear instructions on how the adapter worked once plugged in I went into a party chat with some friends and played with the controls until I found a reasonable chat and game volume mix. (now that I know how the buttons work, I will need to adjust a little more so that only chat comes from the controller and no game sound) As with all plugs and adapters I have used in the past, I leave them all plugged in to the controller. If you constantly plug and unplug the adapter, eventually the fit will be loose and you will not have a functioning unit. this is designed better than the 360 versions, but the same principl applies.My take on the adapter;ProsIt works as advertised. I am able to use my TB headset for the first time since the xBox One came out. This alone was worth the twenty five price tag.The One system apparently has a much better setup for chat as I now have to have the mic much further from my mouth than I did with the 360.it is the same exact size as the one that came with the system so you just plug it in and your hands are used to how it feels on the controller.Cons:Lack of clear instructions on how it actually worked.The 3.5 to 2.5 adapter shouldn't be needed as most headsets I have seen made for gaming systems were all 2.5mm to start with. as they made the adapter, it should have had an angled plug and not a straight one so that the controller was more compact feeling without a cord sticking out an inch or so that gets bent and flexed more than it needs to.Controller battery life!!! I though the controller used batteries at a faster pace than the 360 did, but with the firmware update and the new aadpter in use, I find that I am replacing the batteries at an incredible rate. (Thank goodness for rechargable Eneloop batteries.) I also noticed that I'll often get the message to turn my controller back on and I look down and see the light still on. This is a product of the firmware update and software more than the adapter, but it is still an issue that MS needs to address as you need the update in order to use this adapter.Edit June 21 2014I've had the controller adapter now for a bit over 3 months according to the Amazon review I wrote. In my original review I noted that the 2.5 to 3.5mm adapter was a poor design. My concerns have been confirmed. I found myself not being able to hear anyone for the last few days. I realized that if I pushed a certain way on the cord where it enters the adapter that I could hear people speaking. I now have to find a replacement or wait for MS to send me a new one. (as long as a local replacement allows chat use, I'll just do that)Overall I would give the actual headset adapter 5 stars because it does everything I want it to. They also sorted out the battery life issue as a second update now allows battery life that is at least double what it was out of the box from Microsoft. With the poor 2.5 to 3.5mm cable adapter the overall rating is still a 4.\"]\n",

A downfall is if you already had a turtle each headset you don't need the full product you just need a certain conversion for it. Shame on Microsoft trying to make more money from us. Another downfall I had a problem with is mics' make sure your stereo headset is not a 3 button inline headset because the mic will not work. It must be a one button inline mic. I tried so many times to get my beats solos drenched in blue to work with this. I just had to buy one of the old studio wires and use that. The bad this with this mic is it picks up every sound in the room.\"]\n",

Part of me is there, though the other part of me says I need to rate the merits of the device and it's functionality.The Stereo Headset adapter worked perfectly for me. I've been using optical out with my Turtle Beach and SteelSeries H headphones for a while, and using Kinect for chat. Now I don't have to bother with that.Before you can use the adapter, you MUST update your controller's firmware. According to the manual, you are supposed to take the batteries out, plug in the included micro USB cable (very short cable, kinda worthless using it for anything else), plug the adapter into the controll and then power up the system. Problem is, it doesn't work the way the manual claims. Doing this means the controller powers up, but doesn't do anything else. If you do this, you have to go into Settings -&#62; System -&#62; Update controller and then follow the onscreen instructions. I'm not sure if this works if the system is powered on, you are logged in and then plug the headset in as I don't have other controllers to try.The other important part to remember is the update process for the controller came down with the March Xbox One update. If you don't have this update for whatever reason, you can't use the adapter and will need to update first.Once your controller is updated, plug the included 3.5mm to 2.5mm cable into the audio port on the adapter, then plug your headset in. Assuming you don't have any of the issues of some of the other reviewers, game chat should work, it should work well and do exactly what you expect and want. I can't speak for anyone else's experience - my experience, other than the update process detailed in the box, was faultless.If you don't want to invest in ANOTHER gaming headset, then this MSRP $25 adapter will save you some money and bring the functionality you've been wanting back to the Xbox One.Recommended if you need/want this capability.\"]\n",

The design obviously hinges on Kinect usage, with the user vocally calling out &#34;Netflix&#34; or &#34;Hulu&#34; and the remote takes over and an alternative for the joypad as far as UI navigation.The only positive the remote has are specific buttons to control media playback (play/pause, fast forward, etc.)The biggest negative is the remote requires direct line of sight with the console, specifically the remote has to line up with the disk drive (point of reference example.) the remote can NOT communicate via Kinect and won't register unless it has an absolute direct line the the &#34;face&#34; of the main console (angle of attack tolerance is extremely limited.)A glaring oversight with the remote is when you compare the Xbox to the most comparable competing media device. VCR's also have TV pass-through, their remotes...even ones sold after the fact, have number pads to facilitate channel changing in Television mode. On top of that VCR remotes tend to have a button that can toggle between the VCR's UI and TV broadcast without manually going through a UI to change video source. With all the TV integration hype these features are glaringly absent from this media remote, the loss of Kinect as a mandatory interface just enhances the lack of those interfaces on the XB1 Media remoteAdditional food for thought, both 360 remotes by Microsoft have full number pads, which for the 360 are purely vestigial.\"]\n",

            " ['*** Update ****Not 3 days after purchasing the remote, I started experiencing a problem with the Volume buttons not working properly, which apparently may be a widespread problem and not just an isolated bug. The volume button does not always register when pressed. I have to repeatedly press the power button and it may be detected maybe only every other push. Also If I just hold down the volume button, It\\'s only adjust the volume up or down a little, then a pause, then a little more, then a pause, then a little more. Very annoying little bug if your relying on this remote for volume control. I\\'ve dropped from 5 stars to 4 stars. I still really like the remote but I do expect the volume to work normally and will have to contact microsoft about this issue. Maybe a bigger drop in stars is incoming if I don\\'t resolve this problem.****// End Update ****The remote is about half the height of the 360 media remote. Very straight forward and easy to use. Has a soft touch feel that feels really good. The downside of the soft touch material is that it is a bit of a lint magnet. Remote picked up lint just from the packaging it came in and I had to wipe it clean first thing.I\\'m still quite happy with the soft touch and think it will be great in the long run. The remote also has a sensor that turns on the backlighting when you pick it up without you having to do anything. The back light then very gracefully fades after about 5-7 seconds when the remote is placed down again. Very slick and the design akin to something Apple might do. Very good on Microsoft here.To turn on Xbox you long press the Xbox logo button on the remote.This is so much better than using the Xbox One controller as your remote control. It\\'s just less work. Easier to pickup and use one handed. Easier than talking to Kinect all the time...although I still enjoy talking for certain things like Pausing a video or opening an app. A great solution for the non-gaming family members to interact with the Xbox with easily and without clunkiness.It seems like many don\\'t know this, but the Xbox One has an IR blaster in the Kinect device. You can program your Xbox One to control your specific TV and Receiver / Amplifier, or your Cable TV, via the IR blaster. You don\\'t have to run any special cables or anything, the Kinect just bounces high power IR signal around your room and it gets back to your TV, receiver, cable box...etc. You can even control your Amplifier / Receiver audio volume from the Xbox One Media Remote! It works unbelievably well. Go into your Xbox One settings > TV & One Guide > Devices.If you want to change the increment of how much the Xbox One increases or decreases your volume (when controlling by voice), follow these instructions:Go to the Xbox One settings appGo to TV & OneGuide\"Troubleshooting\"\"Audio\"\"Volume Change\"Again the above instructions are only for voice control, \"Xbox Volume Up\". The media remote only does volume control by standard +/- 1 unit of audio and can NOT be adjusted by the above increment settings.So for my fairly straight forward setup where I only use the Xbox One for games, Blu-Ray, and streaming media, I now don\\'t need my Logitech Harmony Remote anymore, or any other remote. This media remote is my ONLY remote!I have a love hate relationship with the Logitech Harmony. With the One remote, my setup no longer needs it!!! My wife will now be able to easily turn on the TV without issues, and unlike the Logitech harmony remote which you had to carefully keep pointing at the TV / Amp / Cable box till it finished all it\\'s commands, lest it get out of sync and be a headache to fix...the Xbox One sends such a powerful blast of IR out to your other devices, that you don\\'t have to think about how long you point the remote.This is a huge feature that the Xbox One has that the PS4 does not. It\\'s one of the features made possible by the Kinect device.']\n",
            " [\"I'll start by saying I really like this remote. It feels sturdy and is good of quality as you can expect from something primarily made of plastic. It does the job, and works great. I even like that it is smaller and simpler than my older Xbox 360 and PS3 remotes. I only wish they hadn't downsized it SO much.I actually haven't missed the number buttons my 360 & PS3 remotes have. I never realized how little I used them until they were gone and it didn't affect me much. They are mostly just used for chapter selection in a DVD, where I usually just use the next/previous chapter buttons for anyway. The backlit keys are a nice feature that my black 360 remote doesn't have (though my old white one does). There are times when I wish some of the old functionality was here. I also liked the A,B,X,Y buttons so I could navigate through any DVD or game menus the same way as a normal controller without needing to figure out which buttons mapped to what functions. I liked my black Xbox 360 remote's separate power buttons for both the TV and Xbox. And call me crazy, but I also liked having an eject button. I suppose that one makes more sense to remove with a slot-loading drive though.The button style is closer to the newest black Xbox 360 remote design, where they are hard and clicky instead of the older white Xbox 360 remote design that had soft, subtle buttons. I don't really have a preference as far as hard/soft buttons go, just pointing it out.Probably the biggest con though, is shared between this one as well as all versions of the Xbox 360 one: infrared. My PS3 controller uses Bluetooth, so it works from anywhere in my house regardless of line-of-sight with the IR receiver. This Xbox One remote, like all the Xbox 360 remotes, require a line-of-sight with your IR receiver (Kinect), so it's not as reliable. The small upside of this is longer battery life, but I'd trade that for Bluetooth given the choice.So overall, it certainly gets the job done, but isn't perfect. I also am not thrilled about how much higher the Xbox One accessories are priced at. This remote is tiny and plastic, but has a much higher MSRP than the more feature-filled Xbox 360 and PS3 remotes. Price of early adoption I suppose. Negatives aside, I don't regret buying it and I'm sure I will get plenty of use out of it.\"]\n",

I wasn't concerned about it not being programmable since I do utilize Kinect to power everything on via voice controls and the console is programmed to increase the volume accordingly based on the assigned devices.  The downside is when I switch over to Uverse and get the classic &#34;Select Recordings&#34; by pressing Ok on the Uverse Remote, there is no such function on this media remote and the &#34;Select&#34; button brings up a redundant set of xbox commands that are all on the remote as actual buttons. (Fast Forward, Pause, Play, etc.)  While Microsoft would have to program an abundance of changes for every TV provider, I think it is plausible to do so starting with the larger ones and work their way down the list.  Uverse only has 2 or maybe 3 remote standards from what I've seen.If the select button on the remote would convert to the Uverse standard while watching TV in addition to converting the Xbox menu button to the Uverse menu button would be fantastic, and I hope that is coming in the next software update.Another thing I have noticed is that the Kinect censor IS NOT carrying the signal to the Xbox, you do have to point it at the Xbox, which I find rather odd.  Maybe that is something that will also be fixed in the next update.  Or I am completely off on this, but that is my observation.Overall it's a solid peripheral at a good price (standard retail) and it will be used for watching movies across the various apps and for TV after I press the OK button on the Uverse remote every morning to watch my BBC News.\"]\n",

If you're just going to use the 360 for DVDs, menus or purchases, you can use the remote entirely, skipping the controller completely!  But the X1 remote isn't quite as useful.  And, I'm shaking my head at some of its design choices, which range from just sad to flat-out irritating.I'm okay with it having fewer buttons. The number buttons won't really be missed. But there are functions I miss across the board: no buttons to access the DVD/Blu-ray menus, no ABXY buttons, no power button, no Display or Info buttons.  I actually used those with regularity.So what buttons DOES the remote have?  Well, it's hard to tell, because there are no English labels on ANY of the buttons.  All you get are icons.  Some are self-explanatory, like Play/Pause, Stop, Forward and Back, because those icons are the same on almost every device.  But many of the others range from &#34;oh, I get it&#34; to &#34;what the heck is that?&#34;  I know that the X1 is sold in many places, but I'm not a fan of the recent trend: companies shifting from supporting one or multiple languages to supporting no languages at all.  I'm sick of having to decipher confusing, meaningless icons when one or two words could have given me some actual information.The buttons illuminate, which is nice.  But when they aren't lit up, the icons on each button are a dark grey on black.  Unless the room is well-lit, they are barely visible.  If the room is fairly dark, you won't be able to make them out at all.  So before you can actually press a button on the remote, you have to tilt or shake it, which causes the buttons to light up.  If you were going to pick up the remote anyway, it doesn't matter, but if you just wanted to push a button while it's lying on a table, you're out of luck.  Oh, and when the buttons light up, they don't stay lit for very long...it's a mere 3 seconds before the light starts to fade.  It does not appear that the amount of time can be adjusted.  So you may have some trouble even if you're just trying to stare at the icons to figure out what they do.Despite all of this, I can still find some pros. It's one of the smallest remotes I own, so there's something to be said for that.  It is nice to be able to manipulate the X1 without waking up the controller or having to use voice commands, which are convenient but not always as easy to use as physical buttons.  The most essential functions--pause, play, skip forward--work just fine.So as a somewhat-functional remote, and an alternative to the most basic voice commands, it's a success.  But if they released an updated, more useful version--or simply allowed use of the 360's media remote via a firmware update--I'd toss this thing in a heartbeat.\"]\n",

Like I said for the crazy price of those other two and how they basically lack all new features and have nothing more then these have ... save your money and buy these and save the rest for when the Dolby Digital 7.1 headsets make a come back ... and most of all you can hear yourself talk.If the Polks get updated within the next 2 weeks and the sound is THAT much better from all the things I read then I May MAY give them a try ... if not I will be satisfied with these very much so till some new more modern headsets get released this summer.The comfort is great on these (I like then SO much better in that arena then my older TB X12's and my latest XP400's) ...

            " [\"I don't own the headset, or an Xbox one for that matter, but I have gotten to play with them, so here's my impressions. How it works is it comes with an adapter you plug into the Xbox one controller, and then plug this headset into the adapter on the controller, and that's how it works. It's wireless audio from the Console to the controller, through the cable to the headset! It's quite nice. I didn't get to test the microphone, but the audio was quite well. It sounds like an $80 headset. They are also quite comfortable, extremely comfortable! They just use the standard 2.5 mm plugin like most headphones, so you can use these with your MP3 player or something. While waiting for my turn to play with the console, I used these headphones on my Zune HD, and my music sounded great! If you want a cheap headset with your console, this will fill the bill! Highly recommended (when I get my own pair, I'll try out the microphone, and edit this review).\"]\n",
            " [\"Tested with an extensive few rounds of Plants vs Zombies. These headphones are really pretty darn good. The build quality is stand out excellent. Very sturdy feeling and well made in comparison to my Turtle Beach wireless headset.The mic is very sturdy and hides away nicely into the side of the headphones when you don't need it. The controls are very good too and I love that the headphones run off of the controller battery!Sound quality is very good and comparable to my Turtle Beach headset. Doesn't have the virtual surround sound, but sound is still very much positional. Like when I rotated around I could definitely hear distinctly what was going on on each aide of me.I still really do like to have a simulated surround sound option and I hope that Microsoft includes such a feature in a future update. Totally doable since the controller firmware is upgradeable.\"]\n",
            " [\"the adapter alone is 25$ so adding these to it makes them 55$ and end of the day, a 50$ headset is about what you are getting here.  They are bulky, ulgy, rigid, the cups are of average quality(not made of faux leather) and the quality is again, average.  The sound lacks punch, sounds hissy, thin, generally cheap and not premium.  To its credit, the cups are big and will encompass your ears better then the polk.  At the price I guess, can hardly complain.As I mentioned, i also grabbed the Polk 4shot and for the price increase, the audio is noticeably better, the connecting wire is detachable, the cups are made of a faux leather that's pretty comfortable.  The audio can still sound tin like, thin but not nearly to the degree of the microsoft ones.  I can't say those are worth the price increase, it is double the price and to each their own on the value vs price front there but all that said, they are in fact undeniably better sounding and better made.  I tried the polk before the Microsoft ones and was frankly disappointed in them, their value rose once I tried the Microsoft ones.My one big complaint on the Microsoft ones would be the connecting wire is not removable from the headset.  That wire itself is flimsy so if it gets damaged, the headset is rendered useless.  This was a dumb move obviously and just adds to the cheap feel of it.  There is occasional static and again I think that's more a product of again the adaptor much more then the headsets.I have a set of polk audio ultra focus 8000 noise cancelling cans(goes for 300$ these days, I paid more) as well.  The general quality was a very noticeable step up but end of the day, wasn't as good as what the set can produce.  There was much more punch, clarity, not nearly as thin, could pick up many more sounds but in comparison to what I've seen this set deliver, it wasn't fully utilizing the set's capacity and it was obvious.  End of the day, I think the stereo adapter is a very limiting factor here.  It's just not delivering a very high quality of sound, by comparison the audio delivered thru the ps4 dual shock controller on a ps4 felt better. I have shure se535 (500$) and beats studio wireless that I tried as well, sound was better then the Microsoft and 4shot again, but again, was not near the quality those sets are capable of delivering.for those curious, multiple controllers/adaptors/headsets can receive sound simultaneously.\"]\n",

The sound quality is awesome, and the adapter comes with the setup as well so that is sweet (and the adapter is very nice. and $25 as a standalone product).Negative: I have noticed that when I am switching between pins and items in the menus, I get a static tiny hiss, which is weird since this is the only place it does it. I guess we can expect an update to fix this, since it seems its an audio file problem with the XB1 menus. Other negative is the cable  is kind of thin and cheap, compared to the rest of the unit.So yea, Once I am in Battlefield 4, it sounds great. You will know you made a wise invested when you load up BF4 and you hear the rainfall in the opening menu. Then in game, its epic.

Certainly comparing these to the included Xbox One headset will make these look like $1000 headphones, not that it means much.[+] The ear cups. They are soft and comfortable, but the comfortability of the headset as a whole could be improved.[+] The cord length. It is easily long enough to do anything you could possibly want to do, short of walking around the room with the headset on after setting your controller down.[+] The \"control panel\", or whatever you want to call it. It has the mute and volume up/down buttons, similar to the included cheap-o headset, but since you can also have the game audio go to this headset as well as chat, you can use the two new buttons to control the volume for game & chat independently, unlike the included headset. I also like the backlight on the mute button for a quick visual cue that no one can hear you, in case you forget (cheap-o headset also has this feature).[+] The mic can fold up and hide well, to make it look like a normal headset, in case you want to look 5% less nerdy wearing these. But personally, I embrace the nerdiness.What I don\\'t like:[-] Comfortable as the ear cups may be, the headset as a whole is a slight downgrade from my SteelSeries Siberia v2 set. The Xbox One headset feels very rigid with its lack of pivot points my other headsets have.[-] The cable is long, but I wish it were thicker. It seems to be about the same size as the basic headset, which took about two seconds for my cat to chew through and ruin. I will make sure to keep this one away from hungry animals.[-] Price seems maybe $10-20 too high. This is really the only option you have at the moment for a fully Xbox One capable headset, so you I can\\'t say I would have expected them to price it lower, but there are many other non-XBO headsets in the same price range that feel higher quality and more durable. I guess time will tell.If the price isn\\'t a big deal to you, the quality and excellent integration with the Xbox One makes these a pretty good sell. I certainly don\\'t regret buying them.']\n",

I play after 9pm when my kids go to bed, but I want to be able to hear the game at a loud and clear level.2.  I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for a &#34;surround sound&#34; headset.  You essentially get a $50 headset with a $30 headset adapter included.What's included:This headset comes with the necessary adapter and the controller update is quick and easy.Quality:I am not an audiophile, but I can say that they sound good, not great.  There is a slight tinny aspect to these, but I'm not really able to compare them against another brand.  If my benchmark is Apple EarPods, then I would say they sound on par, if not the same.  Build quality is very good.  I'm not concerned about them breaking and all movable parts (the hidden mic) move with ease.Comfort:The padding on the cans as well as the &#34;bridge&#34; on top of your head makes these extremely comfortable.  Although they're not the sleekest, or sexiest, these certainly get the job done.Miscellaneous:These aren't noise-cancelling, but you might want to consider another pair if you like to listen to game audio and chatting.  I can't hear myself talk while chatting, so it's hard to regulate the level of my voice.  Again, I don't chat much in game, so I bought these solely for the game audio.  I have resorted to taking one of the cans off my ears so I could hear myself talk while chatting.Pros:+ Build quality and comfort+ Sound - not bad for what is essentially a $50 headset+ Includes the $30 adapterCons:- Not the sleekest looking, don't plan on wearing these in public- There's no mic feedback to hear how loud you're speaking when chatting in-game- Not in my review, but the adapter does cause some crackling with in-game audio.

Also, the voice acting is pretty bad, I continuously hear the enemies spouting the same phrases time and time again.The gameplay just feels clunky.

I've gotten stuck on invisible barriers multiple times in the two hours I've played it. And getting hung up against a wall is very common as well. The gunplay is okay, but not as good as past Cybertron games due to awful hit detection.In the graphics department.... what is this??? It looks like an early gen PS3 game (at best). The wall and floor textures are the ugliest thing I've seen in a game in years. And the vehicles you transform into? Yeah, they're pretty bad too.The first level is almost like playing a children's game. Go here, shoot these guys, pretty easy. Level 2.... RAGE MODE.

Everything about this game is recycled except for the lacking Age of Extinction content, and everything that wasn't recycled looks ugly. Music is awkwardly spliced together from the Fall of Cybertron tracks, the dialogue and story is even cheesier then usual for this franchise, and the level designs are uninspired and unmemorable. It's only real saving grace is that it's using Fall of Cybertron's solid framework, but that isn't enough to elevate it to being fully worth your time and money.

I wanted a green 3DS XL, and having one with Yoshi is a huge bonus for me. I have always been a Yoshi fan. As for the color itself, the color seen on the box image and even Nintendo's website is not the green shade it actually is. Be sure to go to other reviews here or on YouTube to see it unboxed. It is a more bold green than what's pictured. I am also happy compared to some that the image on the front and back are different and not a continuous picture (like the Pikachu model). I would rather flip it over to see a different image than have to open it all the way to see the wonderfulness.Also, I was very pleased with the 3D slider. I have never been a fan of 3D, and initially believed that I wouldn't use it at all. However, with the intensity slider, I can set it at the level I am comfortable with; I do enjoy experiencing the features I paid for.It is indeed very sturdy, somewhat heavier than I would have guessed. It is the XL version, after all. Some people don't like the loud snap that happens as you open the 3DS to the &#34;openness&#34; desired, but it doesn't bother me. It also doesn't bother me that the lid is not firmly snapped open. If you shake the 3DS, the screen will wobble with the movement. I do not have any games currently that require me to use the tilt-motion controls. The screen not locked in place could prove annoying in that situation.I often use headphones to hear those crisp Nintendo sounds, but when I first plugged in, I thought the port was damaged. After some Googling, I found that I simply wasn't plugging in and pressing hard enough until the definitive *snap sound happened. Call me a pushover, but I was careful about being rough with my expensive new device.Choosing to buy the 3DS at all is one decision, and then which model is another. I didn't consider it until I went online and looked at the games available; &#34;Are there enough games I like to justify the purchase? How's the price?&#34; Then, the model's appearance is just personal preference. I am very excited about my 3DS, and Yoshi was the perfect choice for me. It took some contemplation when comparing to the Zelda model.My only complaint is that the Yoshi Green Egg box it came in was damaged in shipping. That's garbage; I am not a collector, but I intended to keep the box to help keep 3DS-related documents and things together.  I also just liked how it looked. Of course, the shipping company is to blame, not Amazon or Nintendo. The interior cardboard allowed the 3DS to arrive unscathed, even if the box is in an unimpressive state.My accessories that I will be reviewing elsewhere:Nintendo 3DS XL Duraflexi Protector - ClearHORI Nintendo 3DS XL Hard Pouch - BlackEverydaysource Compatible With Nintendo 3DS XL Clear Reusable Screen Cover, 5-PackIn short, all satisfied purchases!\"]\n",

While there are advantages the PS4 has like no power brick, supposedly better RAM, and the touchpad on the controller, overall, the Xbox One is more polished and therefore, more enjoyable.Let me give you some examples of what I mean starting with the controller.  Both system controllers feel nice in the hand but the Xbox One's feels just the smallest bit better when using the triggers and joy sticks.  The headphones are much, much better on the Xbox One.  I like that the mute and volume is right there where it plugs into the controller.  Audio quality is good too.  The headphone (singular) that comes with the PS4 is a joke.  It's hard to tell if you have it on mute or on, there is no volume control and the audio isn't that good.  It looks like it cost about 5 cents to make.  Both PS4 and Xbox One have very smooth, fast loading user interfaces and in some ways I prefer the PS4 (easier to see what I'm downloading), but gameplay is significantly smoother and more responsive on the Xbox One.  That being said, it should be noted I'm having to send in my PS4 for service because often the characters don't even respond on screen...could just be an issue with my unit but I've heard others say multi platform games play more smoothly on XB1.Anyway, if you are a fanboy of one or the other (which makes no sense to me whatsoever) then just go ahead and get that system.

Ps4 has no games in my book other than infamous. I still haven't played my copy of the second one. It's sitting on my shelf.

I loved uncharted, reisistance multiplayer but the delays, sound issues, and such made itnpainful to play them at times.I own ps3, xbox 360 (3 of them), wii u (underrated and excellent system), vita,3ds,etc. so I'm not a fanboy.  I buy a system to play games even if they are in 720p.  I would rather play titanfall in 480p than killzone in 1080p. The 'graphical prowess' issue will be addressed in the future i am sure.I had my doubts but microsoft always comes through. I  feel that all items should be considered when deciding which one to buy and not just resolution and/or frame rate and the word of trolls.\"]\n",

But i now own both a PS4 and a Xbox One and can say that im enjoying the Xbox One more. The biggest thing is how awesome the kinect is. I'm the type of gamer that pops the disc and starts but the way you can use the kinect to multitask is just....phenomenal. It makes everything so much easier and faster. And as cliche as it sounds it makes you feel like a part of the game. From commanding your archers to fire in Ryse to yelling &#34;Over Here&#34; in Dead Rising 3 to get zombies attention, it's just......awesome. I absolutely love it.

The versatility of the machine is great, the tight integration of other devices makes this one a winner. The games are great, Xbox Live is much better than the PSN, and so far the kids play the Xbox One more than the PS4.It is kind of hard to explain exactly why I like the Xbox over the PS4, but I do. My kids really wanted the PS4, and we bought it first, I bought the Xbox One a few weeks later, and while the PS4 hasn't been collecting dust, it has taken second place in our living room. I bought a year of PSN Plus, and shortly before buying the Xbox One had renewed our Xbox Live Gold, so it isn't like the PS4 has somehow been crippled or isn't being given a fair chance. In the end both consoles will get squeezed for everything they are worth in our house, the kids are pretty hard core gamers, and they don't exactly have a preference. They didn't seem to have a preference in the last generation either.\"]\n",

The console is about the size of the original x box along with a brick sized power supply. There are quite a few cords and this makes for some hasssle when attempting to set up. The voice commands don't always work and you feel the need to yell to use them. The facial recognition is spot on. The reason I'm giving the system 3 stars is because I had a disc drive malfunctiuon, Luckily I was able to take it back to the store and exchange it. There is absolutely no reason for this to happen. You'd figure they would have learned their lessons with the &#34;red ring of death&#34; on the 360. These malfunctions can be prevented by spending a tiny bit more per console during construction, This laziness almost make me go buy the PS4. If anything happens with my replacement system, the only reason I will use microsoft is for windows gaming on my PC. Titan fall is a blast. The game is fast paced and to my liking, most everyone on there is silent lol. The titans handle well and make you feel big and powerful.

The only complaint I have with this bundle is the full game download card; the game took 6 hours to download onto the HD. The best thing about this download was that the Kinect scans the barcode and the downloading begins, no more typing in the 25 digit code (unless you want too).

            " ['Well I have to say I jumped the boat to next gen gaming consoles with the PS4, but the X1 seems to be a better fit for my taste in games, so take this whole review in that perspective.This system costs $499 shipped as of writing, and it came with Titanfall which retails for $59.99. The game is a digital code, so to some it matters to be its the preferred option. I am not one to trade back games, and I hate getting up to change disks and what not. I play this and my PS4 on a 70&#34; Sony KDL 550R, and both machines look about the same I sit about 9-10ft away.Ok, the system it self is large, and much bigger then the PS4 or PS3, but it fits in my entertainment center very well and blends very well with my receiver. I can see people who are not major gamers liking this option with out making their living room look like a 13 year old runs the house. I really like the sleek boxy look, and its fairly silent, but not dead silent. The system is quieter then the PS4 which at times when playing KillZone gets rather loud due to the cooling. This system requires that the a power brick is used, and unlike the PS4 its not built into the system. So hiding it can be a little bit of a pain, but not impossible with how big the Xbox One is.Kinect...its a love and hate relation ship. When it works it works like a dream, and you really get used to walking into your house and saying &#34;X-box On&#34;. Everything turns on and is sitting on the X-box one home screen, and then in the mornings I say xbox watch tv, and it puts the news on while I have my coffee and get ready for the day. However, we are in the process of redoing our floors, and the whole house echoes and the Kinect is having a hard time hearing X-box One. Yeah, it gets frustrating, but I am sure once everything is back to normal so will be Kinect.Games, Games, Games....see I bought the PS4 not he nothing its the gamers machine. Well BF4 I play on PS4, but its on X1 as well, and having played them side by side I really could not tell the difference in 900p vs 1080p (experts tell me those are the resolutions). However, I am in love with Forza 5, excellent racing game and I am not much of a racer that game is 1080p and looks so amazing. Killer Instinct is a fighting game they offer on a free/paid program. You start the game for free with all options enabled except you get only one character try out with (they rotate characters on a weekly basis), and you can buy characters individually or buy the whole game for $19.99. The gameplay was very refreshing and fun to play, and best part is the training mode. Least, but not last is Titanfall....well where do I begin the game is amazing to say the least. First, I suck at online shooters, and in this game its okay you get to kill dumb AI and still get points lol...so yeah I killed a real person in it there other day was amazing lol. Go to a game site and read proper reviews the game is excellent a a hoot to play with friends. Talking about playing with friends the quality of the game chat is a sharp as using my iPhone its amazing really really good.So overall I am very happy with this purchase, and it comes with a lot of value something I found lacking in the PS4 (now I know it cots less, but seemed I also got less). I love my PS4 and I am sure there will be plenty of games on both platforms, but this Titanfall bundle is hard to beat. Get it while it lasts.']\n",

It lacks the basic abilities that even the Xbox 360 can handle. The face the I can't stream content from my NAS is a big problem. The entire marketing strategy of the Xbox One was to replace all your other living room devices. Well I still need my Boxee to watch movies that are stored on my NAS.Aside from that, and other things like not being able to skype while gaming / watching TV, it's a neat device. It doesn't perform nearly as well as it did in the keynote though. For example, when switching between gaming and TV on the keynote it was instantaneous. In real life, there's some lag and stuttering. It just feels like an incomplete operating system. The overall idea of the Xbox One is awesome. It's implementation, however, has been quite poor. Hopefully Microsoft will be fixing the stuttering, and DLNA support in the near future.\"]\n",

The system is really cool, with a nice interface that integrates your TV watching experience with gaming and apps. The commands work most of the time. There are times that they don't, but it's not a big deal, and I imagine this will improve over time.Titanfall is a really good game, I guess I would give it 4/5 stars. I would give it 5 stars if it had a single player campaign. I have had a lot of fun with this game though. The graphics are really good and the action is intense. There are a lot of unlockable goodies as you level up and complete challenges within the game. I have played a few other games, such as Killer Instinct and Forza 5 as well. Those are also good reasons to own an Xbox One. The best is yet to come of course.If you are on the fence about getting an Xbox One, I would say go for it. It's a great console, and now that you get a game with it, it's that much better.UPDATE 4/16/2014After playing this game more and becoming more used to online multiplayer FPS games, I can honestly say that this is a fantastic game. I was a little upset at first about the lack of single player campaign, but I have gotten over that. Not that it wouldn't be cool if Respawn added one later, but this game is so much fun. It's a real challenge too. There is so much chaos going on in a match. This might not be for people who just want to camp and snipe. This is a great reason to get an Xbox One, of course it is on 360 now if you aren't ready to make the jump to the next-gen consoles. By the way, I suck at FPS games, but still have a blast with this game. I am getting better and this game makes you want to get better.The Xbox One is a great console. No real complaints so far.

There are really no curves to the details if you no what I mean. Lots of colors. If that makes sense. It is a glorified button masher shooter really. There is not a ton of strategy.It came with Killer Instinct on Xbox Live. I remember the old killer instinct and it was quite unique with its horrific sort of evil characters and special abilities - this is like a wanna be street fighter game that is even more of a button masher...which I did not think was even possible.To the system - I basically don't see a lot new here compared to 360. The tv menu is kind of nice - but it is nothing better than my charter tv cable menu. lol. really. Controller feels nice - but nothing that could make up for the lack of games on the system and the overall feeling like not enough novelty is here to justify the relatively large purchase price.I don't post videos of my gaming online. There obviously are next to no games out for either ps4 or xbox one at the moment. Most of the games that are out are already out on the older consoles. Many of the future titles I am interested in are coming out for PC as well such as watch dogs and wolfenstein.

Titanfall and Tomb Raider both freeze, sometimes indefinitely, sometimes for a few seconds. It's a software compression problem, a RAM problem; it's something Satya Nadella needs to fix, because it's just plain embarrassing.The second problem with the Xbox One is app support. There should be many more apps(WWE is one), and the support for added content is weak. However, Netflix runs great on the Xbox One, coupled with a significant high speed connection.As for Titanfall, it's not a great game. There should have been more to it. As a beginner, I routinely am in matches with people who are sick and twisted, and have all the upgrades maxed out. It's just unfair. I'd rather play MW2 than this. The graphics are good. The plot and most of the gameplay is bogus. It's impossible not to die; like a 4 player Halo map, it's hyper redundant for potheads to keep going to the same corridor and get them before they get you. Lame.Tomb Raider Definitive Edition is an outstanding game, greatly improved on Xbox One. Frame rate issues are there, but it's just one of the best games and routinely awesome campaign throughout.I am sticking with Microsoft. I hope the software updates are fixed for Watch Dogs, Halo and the next Batman Arkham game. I hope they are awake and diligently fixing the kinks.\"]\n",
            " [\"This is a truthful and honest review from someone who actually purchased both the Xbox One and PS4 systems this past week.  I'll preface by saying it's not an Amazon verified purchase because although I do the majority of my shopping at Amazon, I've read too many horror stories of rough shipping being the cause behind a lot of the issues experienced by both recent consoles.  Therefore, I opted to purchase from a local brick and mortar shop.  That's not a knock against Amazon but the shipping services.  Just last week I watched a delivery man literally drop a box labeled &#34;Fragile&#34; on the concrete in front of my door.  Ironically, it was an Amazon order. So I figured I'd play it safe and buy local instead of having it delivered.I bought the Xbox One because I was intrigued by Titanfall and heard it was casual gamer friendly.  I also purchased it because many of my peers among the older crowd seem to be more into the Xbox while the PS4 seems to be more popular among younger gamers.  Most of my friends and relatives who are my age own either the Xbox One or 360.  That gives me a better opportunity to game with people among my own age.  I'm also one of the types who actually wanted the additional media features the Xbox One offers other than gaming. For an older casual gamer like me, the Xbox One made the most sense.I loved the Xbox initially.  I had no problems setting it up and creating my Xbox live account.  I then downloaded all pending system updates, created my profile, added my friends and downloaded Titanfall.  The bundle comes with a QR download code for Titanfall that you scan with the Kinect instead of a physical game disk. Despite being a large download, Titanfall downloaded pretty quickly. I purchased a 13-month special Titanfall themed Xbox Live subscription card along with the system but thankfully, the bundle also included a one-month Xbox Live trial code.  I used the enclosed trial code first, figuring it would extend my Live membership to 14-months.  Had I used the card I purchased, I would have been out of $59 when I returned the system.After playing around with all of the cool features like voice and facial recognition, I settled down to play Titanfall for a few hours.  I first went through the training a couple times and then played several game modes.  My favorite was the new beta matching mode.  Despite admittedly being the lowest ranked player on most of my teams, I still had a blast.  It wasn't an exercise in futility where my character got killed every five seconds like I often encountered in other multiplayer FPS games like COD.  The game really is a ton of fun to play, even for newbies, and not too difficult to learn the mechanics. I then made the mistake of taking a break.  When I attempted to resume playing an hour later, the game froze on the loading screen.  I restarted the game several times and also tried restarting the Xbox One but I could not get the game to progress past the loading screen.  Now, before anyone says I have a bad Internet connection, I did a speed test and my download/upload speeds were 83.95/39.25 mbps respectively, and that was over wireless on my laptop.  My ping response from the Titanfall servers was an excellent 17ms.  I also connected the Xbox One directly to the router using an Ethernet cable in a 10/100/1000 port.  So neither Wi-Fi nor internal network issues were the culprit.  After unsuccessfully trying to connect over the next several hours, I decided to sleep on it and try again the next day.  I figured maybe there were network issues with Xbox Live servers.  I tried again the next day but I couldn't even get to the loading screen.  Clicking on Titanfall just resulted in a black screen and no further response. I waited a while longer and tried again with the same result.That was enough for me.  I packed everything up, returned to the store and exchanged it for a PS4.  I realize both new consoles have their respective initial growing pains and the PS4 isn't perfect either.  However, after an entire day of playing Infamous on the PS4, I have yet to experience a glitch whereas I only got three hours of gaming from the Xbox One before I was no longer able to play Titanfall again.  My brother-in-law, also an Xbox One owner, said I should have been a little more patient. Although he admitted to experiencing his own fair share of glitches now and then, he never encountered a problem as lengthy or irritating as mine.  He has not experienced any issues playing Titanfall.  I'm sorry, but after spending $510 + tax on a bundle and Live membership card, I didn't think it was asking too much of a system to simply play a game.  The Xbox One has the capability to be an awesome system and I may very likely buy it again down the road when they finally iron out all the kinks.  I really enjoyed it when it was working properly.  However, for the prices these systems are commanding, to be unable to play a game for two straight days is totally unacceptable. I just want a little more reliability for the amount of money spent.So that was my experience.  I won't slam the Xbox One with a low rating because I don't hate it nor do I think it's a terrible system.  I may have even gotten a faulty console.  I started to give it a three-star rating but I personally think the system is better than merely &#34;ok&#34;.  It's an awesome system that just needs some bugs resolved before it can be truly great.  Had I not encountered the issue with Titanfall, it would have been a five-star review without hesitation.  I also took into account that my brother-in-law has been playing Titanfall relatively problem-free.  However, The main point of my review was to share my personal experience.  I didn't want to risk exchanging and trying another Xbox right now.  My worst fear was activating more codes, possibly encountering more frustrating problems and eventually being told I couldn't return the system again. I was relieved when they exchanged everything, including the unused subscription card.  Most times, they are non-refundable.  Just another thought to keep in mind if you&#8217;re contemplating buying one. I was lucky but your retailer may not be as liberal with returns.\"]\n",

Saying that, I think this console is very intuitive.  I am still figuring out all it can do.  The biggest difference to me was the fact that it is super quiet!  You can barely tell that it is even on!  Plus I love the feature of having all your downloads/updates occuring while the console is off.  But if you are storing your console in a drawer of some sort, make sure you leave it open as it is always somewhat on standby (you can toggle this, but I love the auto updates that occur in the background)All these kids are complaining about the need to install each game, but that is a **MUST** for your game to run smoothly.Kinect has yet to be unlocked from what I can see, however it is nice to have this bundled as well since I know I will be getting the dance games in the future for the family.  Party games rock!Last summer I was so upset with Microsoft's push to make all games digital.  however, now that I have both, I feel that it is a chore to switch out discs...crazy right?  The Titanfall game comes as a digital download, and how nice it is to say &#34;Xbox play titanfall&#34; and not have to even move from the couch.  Dunno...I think its ingenious!  But then you don't get the resell value if you ever decided to trade it in- so there are definitely pros and cons.Give it a shot, it is a nice upgrade from the 360.  Titanfall bundle is nice as it comes with the free game, very fun and fluid.  I give this console 5 stars.&#34;Prepare to drop!&#34;\"]\n",
            " ['The Xbox One already has plenty of reviews that go into detail about its features and flaws, so I won\\'t spend too much time rehashing those points. Basically, it is an excellent system with a game drought. Fortunately, Titanfall is here to wet our game appetites.My main thoughts about this have to do with what is included in this *TITANFALL* bundle:- Xbox One Standard Console- Xbox One Standard Controller- Xbox One Standard Headset- Titanfall Digital Download CodeHere is what is NOT included:- Xbox One Titanfall Edition Console (exists, but is unavailable to the general public; search Google Images, it looks awesome)- Xbox One Titanfall Edition Controller (available separately)- Official Titanfall Gaming Headset (available separately)- Titanfall Retail Disc (available separately)Can you guess where I\\'m going with this? Since this bundle is the same price as the standalone Xbox One console, there\\'s no reason not to buy it if you were going to get an Xbox One anyway. But it is a TITANFALL bundle, yet doesn\\'t even include the awesome-looking Titanfall controller Microsoft designed, nor the console, nor the headset, nor the physical game disc (which can be lent/borrowed/resold/etc). The digital copy is still good, and has its own advantages (doesn\\'t require swapping discs to play the game), but with game installs taking up anywhere from 20-50 gigabytes, I personally prefer to have the physical copy since these 500GB hard drives will get filled up FAST. And re-downloading these huge games and shuffling around all your digital library will get real annoying real fast, and is much more easily done by reinstalling from discs than by re-downloading everything.Anyway, that\\'s really my only complaint with this; the distinct lack of Titanfall in a Titanfall bundle. I\\'ll move on now.Titanfall itself is actually pretty fun. None of the core elements of the game are entirely new, but it is nonetheless a fresh take on the whole Mech genre. It has a lot of focus on RPG-esque level-ups and challenges to help you unlock new weapons and armor abilities. Sound familiar? To keep up with the competition, you pretty much need to quickly learn how to effectively combat the titans as a little defenseless human, otherwise your average life expectancy will be around ten seconds. You\\'ll probably spend about 20-30% of your time in games in your Titan, and the rest outside of it. The quicker you get kills and points, the faster you will reach \"Titanfall\", where your Titan drops and allows you to board it. This is pretty much the whole game, across several different levels.Fun as the game is, I have to admit I\\'m a bit disappointed they didn\\'t put any type of single player/co-op campaign in the game. I always like completing FPS campaigns before jumping into the multiplayer, and I find 4 player co-op campaigns to be particularly fun. Being an EA game and multiplayer-only means you\\'re really just leasing the game for a few years, since EA is known for cutting off its game servers well before the console is past its usable life (several of their 360/PS3 games have had their servers down for years now).I would also have to be honest and say that while Titanfall\\'s graphics are certainly impressive and better than your typical Xbox 360 game, it\\'s not by much. Going from, say, Halo 2 (Xbox) to Gears of War (Xbox 360) had way more noticeable graphical improvements than going from Halo 4 (Xbox 360) to Titanfall (Xbox One). So far, there still just aren\\'t any PS4 or Xbox One game that really make me go \"HOLY CRAP\" like Gears of War did back in 2006. Oh well, maybe those games are still on the way.So overall, this is a great console with great potential still waiting to be fully unleashed. Titanfall brings some much needed life to the party, but I don\\'t think it will be this generation\\'s new blockbuster gaming franchise like Gears of War turned out to be back in 2006. But again, though I\\'m disappointed in the lack of Titanfall \"stuff\" in this bundle, if you were planning on getting an Xbox One anyway, you may as well still get this bundle since a free downloadable game is better than nothing. See you on the battlefield!']\n",

            " ['There are two major reasons that I got the X1 and neither of those reasons are for gaming. For gaming, I still use and will continue to primarily use Steam. Anyways I\\'ve broken down my thoughts about the X1 into sections.[Good]Kinect:1) Improved Tracking: A lot of the old Kinect limitations with distance and brightness are now mostly gone.2) Fitness: Not even the new Wii U can lay claim to this. Steam and PS4 can\\'t do this well either, nor do they really even try. In fact nothing but Xbone can touch this area or further expand on it. Workouts like P90X and Insanity are now integrated with Kinect. Future Kinect features like being able to track your heartbeat just push it further ahead. Future upcoming fitness apps will probably make this feature even better. This is one of the major reasons that I bought the X1.3) (Future) Children\\'s Apps: Yes there aren\\'t any now, but the Sesame Street series was huge on the 360 Kinect. There are also apps from both Double Fine and Half Brick that were really nice for keeping kid\\'s attention. These apps serve as either educational or great distractions for children which is priceless. (It keeps your kids and even other people\\'s kids from running around your house and breaking things.) I am pretty confident that we\\'ll be seeing more soon. This is the second major reason that I got the Xbone. Again in this area, I don\\'t see either Wii U, PS4, or Steam even trying. Many people will retain their sanity around kids with Kinect.4) With the most recent software update, Kinect voice commands now work as advertised about 80% of the time, though at times I still have trouble getting \"Xbox On\" to work. (Yes I have properly configured Kinect.) Still in many cases, it\\'s still easier to make selections with a controller. This is really useful only for parents who may not have any hands free to use a remote or controller, or for people who constantly lose the remote. I don\\'t feel that this is useful for anyone else since the controller is still the most efficient way to get things done assuming that your hands are free, so it\\'s not really an awesome feature for normal gamers.New Controller: I\\'ve heard the complaints, but I don\\'t understand why. No it doesn\\'t feel like it cost $100 million dollars to develop (lol this has to be the biggest marketing joke ever). However it is better than the old 360 controllers which were already pretty good. It\\'s also still better than the Wii U\\'s, PS4\\'s controller (even though PS4\\'s has more features), and probably than the Steam Controller (which will probably be worse than all of them).Silent: Unlike the 360, which sounded like a vacuum cleaner (or a leaf blower when you paired it with extra fans); the Xbox One is silent. It is awesome.Forza: This is an awesome launch title that really shows off the console. I don\\'t care about Gran Turismo anymore.TitanFall: It\\'s nice that this is free.[Bad]Xbox Live:1) (FIXED Summer 2014) Unnecessary Paywall: Outside of games, NOTHING WORKS without an Xbox Live Gold subscription. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Facebook, Crackle, and a ton of services that Microsoft doesn\\'t host are still locked behind the Xbox Live paywall i.e. you have to pay the $60 per year Xbox Live tax to get access to them. X1 is crippled unless you pay Microsoft\\'s $60 yearly extortion fee. I can understand paying for multiplayer and maybe even for the Fitness Hub (eh not really for the fitness apps that you have to pay for), but there\\'s no excuse to extort money for the other stuff. It\\'s free on Apple TV, Roku, Google TV aka Android TV, and even on Wii U and PS4. This really needs to be fixed and is the most broken thing on Xbox One. It\\'s the one biggest ripoff for consoles and it kills the notion of the X1 being the one box for everything. Who in their right mind would pay $60 a year and not just get the same access to Netflix and Amazon for free on the Roku or Apple TV.2) Previously purchased games do not migrate to X1: All the downloadable games, primarily the Live Arcade ones, that I bought for 360 are forever stuck on the 360, a dead box. Compare this to Steam, where a lot of the games I bought I can play on Mac, Linux, and so far on every new version of Windows. My paid Steam games will still work if I ever decide to buy a nice new fancy PC in the future.  It\\'s the 21st century and it\\'s now the norm to expect your software purchases to migrate to new hardware. It\\'s not even just Steam, the 800 lb gorillas iOS and Android do it too. If I can help it, I will never purchase downloads from MS again, disc only. In Microsoft\\'s defense PS4 and Wii U don\\'t do this either. This is yet another reason for gamers to go Steam.3) No point in buying download versions of disc games: The price is about the same and there\\'s no great feature to really differentiate it like Family Share. O yeah Family Share is already on Steam. It\\'s in BETA but it\\'s active right now.4) They are going to charge for the Health portion of X1 separate from Xbox Live. It\\'s already bad enough that they\\'re charging for things like Netflix and Amazon Prime, not they\\'re going to try to nickel and dime people even more. This will make most of the health features useless.Kinect Issues:1) (FIXED Summer 2014 - no longer required) It adds $100 to the cost. If you heavily rely on Kinect like me, this isn\\'t an issue. However I don\\'t think most gamers will be relying on Kinect any time soon if ever if history is a good predictor of the future. This is the first major reason that people will buy a PS4.2) Use in Gaming: As I\\'ve already pointed out, speech recognition doesn\\'t count since Kinect doesn\\'t even process any of the speech. Historically I can\\'t think of any major games that used the Kinect\\'s motion recognition ability in a great way. Why? Because it costs too much for 3rd party developers to really customize for one console as opposed to just having the same game on all of them. Only MS and its subsidiary game developer houses will be able to do it. Sadly even MS itself can\\'t really figure it out, since Kinect games were absent from its E3 presentation. At launch there\\'s only the Wii Sports knockoff and Forza still uses a controller. I predict Kinect will only be used for Dancing games, Fitness apps, and Children\\'s apps and games. Real games will probably not use Kinect\\'s motion detection until MS gets its act together and at the very least announces a VR solution. Even Sony officially has one now.3) You still need a lot of room for Kinect, just not as much room like the older one needed.4) Most features like the kids games and even the workout apps aren\\'t here yet. They\\'re not even on the release schedule yet. If you\\'re looking forward to any of that, you\\'ll be waiting about two years minimum if not more.5) It\\'s still not fast enough. There\\'s still lag in recognizing what you\\'re doing. This may be more of an issue with X1\\'s horsepower than with the Kinect itself, or a combination of the two. (Maybe if they added more processing power to the Kinect, it\\'d be able to offload more of the work away from the console itself.)It doesn\\'t feel Next-Gen in graphics and just in general: PS4 doesn\\'t either. This is apparent with both X1\\'s 720P upscaling limitation and PS4 stuttering at 1080P. My two year old $426 PC with $149 video card does way better in this department in both quality and performance. It also doesn\\'t help that the same games have awesome user created mods for PC. I\\'d say the major tablets will all catch up in hardware horsepower within three years. What\\'s real next-gen? Next-gen isn\\'t TV integration. Next-gen is VR like Oculus Rift. What\\'s sad is now even Sony has a VR solution coming in the future for PS4. Microsoft is just completely quiet on this one. MS really needs to step it up. Kinect is made for VR.Game Prices: So far nothing beats the prices and the frequency of sales for Steam or GOG on the PC. Getting a new or used game is just so expensive for the consoles and they\\'re the same games as PC. This is the other reason that a lot of people like me will continue to use Steam as their primary gaming platform. Buying games on Steam and GOG (and even Green Man) is just way way cheaper, especially if you just wait one to two months after release.For all the emphasis MS marketing has put on TV, TV integration isn\\'t great:1) X1 softens the image. Many people won\\'t notice, but a lot of techies will.2) Even if you disable standard definition channels from One Guide, when you use voice commands, it will still take you to the SD version of the channel instead of the HD version of the same channel.3) Competing TV products that have already been working well only cost one hundred dollars.Lack of Good Exclusive Launch Titles: Ryse sucks. Dead Rising is so so. Titanfall and Forza are a start, but really it\\'s just Forza.Horsepower: PS4 currently has a slight edge and it\\'s a $100 cheaper. It\\'s really a minor complaint since both machines are pretty weak. What makes it even worse for the X1 is that it does a lot of extra processing that the PS4 doesn\\'t have to do like analyzing your voice with Kinect commands since the Kinect itself doesn\\'t do it.Pretty Slow Load Times: Load times for the launch games are horrible, especially for Forza. It doesn\\'t make any sense since it\\'s reading everything from the hard drive unless it\\'s still doing online DRM checks while the game is playing.Really Slow Install Times: It shouldn\\'t take an hour to install a game from a disc. It\\'s faster to download and install games on my PC using Steam which doesn\\'t make any sense since my download speed with Steam over the Internet is 10 mbps (most of the a little slower) and the read speed from an X1 Blueray is 50 mbps. Why does it take an hour? DRM. For some reason it takes Microsoft an hour to verify that you actually bought the game through the internet which is really annoying. Pirates will eventually find a way around this. The only people this hurts are paying customers like me.No Harddrive Upgrade Option: (Fixed in future 2014 firmware) With PS4 you can replace the stock hard drive with anything you want like an SSD. With X1 it\\'s currently not possible to upgrade the hard drive. Even if it were, you\\'d probably be forced to buy MS\\'s overpriced hard drives. Consequently with games being about 40-60 GB, you\\'re probably only going to be able to install about 10 games, give or take, before you need to delete and re-install other games which will take over an hour.[Misc]I am lucky: Unlike many PS4 and Xbone owners, my unit seems to be free of defects (at least for now). Then again we\\'ll all know for sure since the defects will surface within two years if they exist.Do not buy this from Gamestop, especially if it\\'s a ripoff bundle. I\\'d say it\\'s only smart to buy at  Amazon and Costco.I got X1 for free after a bunch of trade-ins at Gamestop, specifically the ripoff bundle. I would not have gotten this system if I had to pay for it.[Verdict]If you just want something for games, I would at least give Steam a look. Upgrading a desktop PC that you already own with a decent graphics card (about $150 - $200) is also way cheaper than either PS4 or X1. Xbox controllers also work on PC. I know that if I was a poor middle school, high school or college kid, Steam would be the best thing since you can get so many games on the cheap (most of the console games except for a few exclusives are on Steam), it works with TVs now (a lot of video cards have HDMI out too), and games on PC look and play better than on X1 or even PS4. Steam also has major sales every quarter, so a problem I have is that I have too many games than I have time to play. Oh yeah unlike PS4 and Xbone, you don\\'t have to pay for multiplayer and you can share games with up to 10 people in your friends list. Steam works on Mac, Windows, and now Linux.If you\\'re one of the few old people like me who has money to blow, you care about hi-tech fitness, and something to keep little kids occupied and from driving you insane, then the Xbox One is for you.']\n",

It's the only gaming system that i could literally leave on for DAYS yes Days at a time and never have any overheating or hardware issues. Try that with anything else..

Also you could play a game and watch tv at the same time which is useful if you want to listen to CNN or keep score of a game, really the possibilities are endless. If your choosing between a PS4 and this it's more of a preference kind of decision.The PS4 seem's to be a nice gaming system and has slightly more graphical power (but same graphics) but personally i want my video game system to do much more than just video games. The xbox one offers that in spades.Even if you want just video games from your system the xbox is excellent at that as well (i love video games) and the xbox one offers an excellent online gaming and social experience and the controller is the best i've ever experienced (i also own ps2,360,ps3) You could even make phone calls with the xbox using skype by simply speaking in front of the kinet. I actually ordered pizza with it once haha.Overall i would rate the xbox one itself a 9/10. It's a excellent console that just needs more games available to it. The future is bright though for xbox as there are many new games coming out this year for xbox one and many are xbox exclusives. Titanfall is probably the best multiplayer shooter (yes better than cod and bf4) and Titanfall 2 will be released in a couple of years (xbox exclusive as well) and Halo will be coming to xbox one soon. Plus the Microsoft cloud and Microsoft's frequent updates to the xb1 make the possibilities endless. There really is no limit to how far this console can be pushed. Microsoft has big plans for it, in the future.* I strongly suggest getting a TV mount for the Xbox KinetAgain a big part of your decision between PS4 and Xbox one will be based on preference. My advice? if you own a xbox 360 get a xbox one but KEEP your 360 as well. If your not sure the xbox one will be right for you, i recommend you try it out. A lot of these negative reviews scared the crap outta me but i made the leap anyways.

            " ['If you have a family or housemates the Kinect is extremely useful for automatically knowing who is using the system and logging in all the appropriate people instantly. Automatic sign in with the Kinect works amazingly well and usually happens faster than your TV can even turn the screen on. The thing can spot me from the other side of the living room. The Kinect controls the power on/off for your TV as well as the volume of your speakers. If you plan to use the live-TV or have a complex entertainment center with external speakers, cable or other streaming devices running through the Xbox you should definitely get the Kinect version. Here\\'s why: the Kinect has an amazing IR blaster built into it that can turn on/off all of your devices as well as control the volume, the playback controls and channel of what you\\'re watching. So even if you don\\'t have cable TV (let\\'s assume you have a Roku, Apple TV, Fire TV, or Xbox 360) the Xbox One\\'s Kinect will control playback on those devices (pause/play/rewind/fast forward) via controller, voice, gesture and Xbox SmartGlass. The free SmartGlass app turns your smartphone or tablet into a very powerful universal remote by using the Kinect to send IR signals to all of your devices.In addition with Kinect you also have a slew of other options like Xbox \"Record That\" game DVR, Skype video calling, Twitch camera broadcasting, Bing universal search of store/app content, controller tracking to know which person is playing and holding the controller, and instant QR code scanning \"Xbox use a code\" to redeem DLC/points/subscriptions.For a hundred more you get a free game and a Kinect sensor. Even if you are not interested in any of the Kinect games (Fitness, Dancing, Music, Sports, Party, weird Japanese/Indie experimental games) it is still a good idea to get this version with Kinect. Down the line voice controlled services like Cortana (currently on Windows Phone) are coming to Xbox One and most likely VR games which will need Kinect. Most games also make use of the Kinect voice for menu navigation and controls. For a hundred more it is a good investment. I think the sensor will probably cost more to buy separately down the line. The original 360 Kinect launched at 149, the Kinect 2 for Windows costs 199. If you think you might want to have Kinect down the line you will end up paying more than just buying it now bundled.Obviously everyone\\'s funds are different and I\\'m not here to judge what you can afford right now, but it seems clear the Kinect version with a free game is without a doubt a better overall value given how much additional stuff you get.']\n",

To make things sweeter, I also got an additional 1 month free of Xbox Live Gold membership, since they were giving out these cards with a physical purchase of Titanfall. I spoke to a blue shirt and he told me I can take one if I get the bundle too. Thanks Best Buy!Best Buy also has a deal on \"accessories\", where you get them for 15% off if you buy a game, well this comes with a game and rings up the accessory for an extra 15% off.So I bought the Titanfall Bundle + the cool Limited Edition Titanfall Wireless Controller + an extra month of XBL for a few bucks more than Amazon wanted for the base bundle. Seems brick and mortar stores are finally able to compete with Amazon!It may be worth calling your local Best Buy to see what kind of a deal you can get, since Amazon still has not bothered to price match the Walmart or Best Buy deal.Now on to the bundle - It does not come with a physical copy of the game, nor does it come with the special limited edition Titanfall painted controller. No idea why, but it comes with the standard black controller, and a code to download the game onto your Xbone.While I am still downloading Titanfall, I can already say that the new Kinect is simply awesome. I love controlling everything by simply giving it voice commands.I will update this review later with more info on the game itself, but if YouTube videos are anything to go by, I will not be disappointed...UPDATE:Amazon now has a code - \"XIAMAZON\", that when entered brings down the price of this bundle by $50.Way to go Amazon! I hope my review is what got you guys to do this. Probably not, but I can hope, can\\'t I?So now Amazon is once again the top dog. Having said that, I am still happy with my Best Buy purchase because I got the additional controller I wanted, and an extra XBL card on top of that.Edit: According to the manager at my Best Buy, to qualify for the extra XBL card, I had to buy the Limited Edition controller, and the Titanfall game. Not just the game. That is why the LE controller is also 15% off when bought with Titanfall (or the bundle), and the normal controller is not. So just FYI for those interested.As a side note, the LE controller looks and feels exactly like the original Xbone controller, but the TF paint job gives it an extra OOMPH (IMHO).UPDATE 2 (4/6/2014):TARGET now has this bundle + 12 months of Xbox Live all for $449.99.

            " [\"Out of all of the Xbox One games I've played, Titanfall is probably the most fun.  However the game is not all it is cracked up to be.  It is pretty much a multi-player only game, and it doesn't do a whole lot to differentiate itself from other online shooters.  It's a good game don't get me wrong.  Maybe it was just all of the hype that caused my expectations to be high.  This game was hyped up to be revolutionary, but it's more evolutionary in my opinion, and the game itself doesn't have a whole lot of substance or value.With that said, considering it's essentially free (over 16GB download) the overall package is pretty decent.  Just hope you don't get a unit like my launch unit where the disc drive made grinding noises.  Fortunately my replacement unit works fine so far.Another alternative is the PC version if you have a decent system.  It doesn't require much -- a mid-range build will run it with better framerates and better image quality than Xbox One.  I have played both versions and the Xbox One's framerate dips into the 40's a lot of the time, and sometimes even into the 30's (look at Digitalfoundry at eurogamer).  The framerate was much on the PC I was playing on, which was running a Radeon R7 250x ($100) and a FX-6300 CPU ($120); running at 900p with similar settings to the Xbox One.  Framerate is important in a 'twitch' shooter like this.I also found that the PC version was a bit less buggy than the Xbox One version.  There were a few times where the game was briefly a slide show.  Fortunately this didn't happen during any battles and it was quite rare.  Seeing as how a few reviewers mentioned this (ie Giant Bomb), apparently I'm not alone.\"]\n",
            " [\"I fell for this console after I swore to myself I wouldn't waste my time or money on another Microsoft product.  After all the Xbox 360's I kept buying only for them to die from the dreaded yet completely inevitable Red Ring of Death I knew that there would be not satisfaction with an 'upgrade' to a Xbone.But it was on sale today at Best Buy with this bundle for $450 and i guess i had too long of a day at work and just made a impulse buy.  So i get it home and yep after it completely failed to hook up to the first tv set for no fathomable reason I got it to finally turn on and produce a signal on the other tv set.  So then I plugged in the Internet password and it got all the way to 17% update completion before failing utterly as only a Microsoft Product ever truly can.I tried for an hour to get it to work looking up the steps on various Microsoft help boards.  Nothing worked and then it dawned on me.  Every last minute I waste on this abortion of a product is time away from my precious and much better and more powerful PS4.How is it that something far superior requires less effort?  And this isn't just some inherent Fanboyism.  I would be absolutely thrilled if i could plug this in and have it work.  If I wanted a struggle for a system to get up and running I woulda spent more money on a  gaming computer.I'm too old and far too stressed to bother ever having another Microsoft product allowed into my adobe.  They just don't work.  They are poorly designed.  They are way too fragile and the least bit of modern specifications that attempted to be placed on the silly thing will just make it do a complete nothing.Who needs to spend $20 million to fly for a week up in space to stare into the black abyss of nothing when they can blow $500 on a Xbox One; plug it in and see it do less than the vacuum of space itself?But I don't blame Xbox division of Microsoft.  They've been foisting their garbage on millions and millions of us worldwide.  I guess I coulda lit a match to a stack of twenties and watched the same $509 go up in flames (that includes the 12 month Gold Membership-another scam of the deepest order) and had the same empty feeling as unboxing this spectacular failure.The only  thing that has brought me more unmitigated disappointment was the 4 WCW pay per views I got sucked into watching back during the glory days of the mid 90s.  Or the time I blew $12 on a Motley Crue greatest hits c.d.  Or when I got a subscription of Esquire and compounded that idiocy by accidentally getting the auto-renewal 'feature'.  Or the $90 I spent for a day at a Disney Water park on it was cold & wintery in mid-April last year.  Or the $6.50 each time I go see a Ryan Reynold's movie at the cineplex.But at least most of the time I learned from my brazen foolish.  Why I did it today is a lesson I shan't soon forget and sadly I shan't soon figure out either.  At least a crack addict has more self-pride then I obviously continue to exhibit.\"]\n",
            " ['Too long and don\\'t want to read? We\\'ve gone through three defective units. Quality control is sorely lacking.On Black Friday 2013, we stood in the cold, late night, and waited for our turn to pick out a new console. We picked up a Xbox One along with a few games and extras. Since we were so tired when we got home, we waited until the next day to set everything up. We set it up, and everything seemed to work fine. The updates and other installs took ages, but they finally finished, and it was time to dive into a game.We played Dead Rising 3 for a few hours and then it was time for bed. We put the Xbox One into standby mode. The next afternoon, it was time for more gaming. But to our surprise, we pushed the power button and nothing happened. The Xbox just stared blankly back at us. No lights on the console or the power supply. We did some research and tried some of the ideas. We tried to unplug and plug back in. Nothing. We noticed that when we plugged it in, the power supply light would come on orange, then flicker white, and then go off completely. We plugged the power supply in without being attached to the Xbox One, and the light would stay orange, but then when we plugged it into the Xbox One, the light would flicker white and then go out again. There was very little insight into this issue. All research pointed toward the power supply. Even a quick chat with Microsoft noted the same.Rather than go through any return process with Microsoft, we packed it up and headed to the store the next day. This made sense because it was definitely within the return period. The guys at the store checked things out and got the same results, apologized, and offered an exchange.We agreed to the exchange and headed home with a nice, shiny, new system. We immediately plugged it in knowing that updates take a while. Well, another surprise... no video. No video would show on the screen at all. No green loading screen with the pretty Xbox logo. Nothing. We tried the \"unplug, wait, and plug back in\" tricks. Tried different cables. Tried a different TV. Tried a different power outlet. Nothing! The Xbox One powered up, but no video. After self-troubleshooting, we didn\\'t even think of calling Microsoft, we just packed it up and headed back to the store.Again, the guys there checked out the unit, got the same symptoms, and found no resolution. Again, they apologized and offered an exchange (although they didn\\'t have any more at the moment). At that point, we figured that it just wasn\\'t meant to be. We\\'d spent our money in good faith and received nothing but headaches. So we instead asked for a refund. We were given a hard time since the store didn\\'t normally accept opened hardware for refund, but after some begging, they made it happen. However, we only got partial refund for the game and a controller that had been opened, so we were out a bit of the money. We were more upset about the wasted time and emotions.We agreed to hold off a few months in hopes that Microsoft could work out the kinks. Then came the Titanfall Bundle. We wanted it, and we were willing to test the waters again. We purchased the Titanfall Bundle, took it home, and unboxed it. We were extra careful - even more so than usual - with everything. We powered it up with our fingers crossed, and it worked! We were off to a good start. The updates trickled down, and Titanfall downloaded.Then... Titanfall started. And our happiness turned to sadness - again! The fans spun up, and the console sounded like it was chopping up peanuts. It sounded like an RC plane propeller. Nothing went near the Xbox One between the time everything was installing and Titanfall loaded. We looked inside the console grooves with a flashlight, and everything looked in order, but visibility is limited. The fan grew more and more angry, so we powered down and tried to bring it back up. The same fan noise presented itself.That was it. We were done. Xbox One lost us - whether they care or not.Collectively, we\\'ve owned almost every game system there is. We like to try the latest and greatest. And we don\\'t mind jumping in and trying them upon release. With that said, we\\'ve never been through such headaches repeatedly with a product. Fool me once... Fool me twice... Well, three times makes us the fool.We do think the Xbox One has potential, and the game line up is tempting, but the hardware quality assurance is way too flawed at this point. A few folks we hear from say they have no issues. Well, we\\'ve had three with showstopper issues. 2 that made the system useless, and 1 that scared the dogs and woke us from REM sleep.While we would like to tell a different story here, we can\\'t. We can\\'t tell you how great the system looks, feels, and behaves. We can\\'t tell you how great the GUI looks. We can\\'t tell you how amazing the games are. We can\\'t tell you how comfortable the controllers are. We can just tell you to stay away from the Xbox One. Avoid it. And if you ignore our warning, we can only wish you luck that you end up with a working system.']\n",
            " [\"I'm not one to be obsessed with anything, but man can this thing do it all. I find myself using my Xbox one for everything because that is what it was built for. I play video games with great graphics, and play online shooters a lot.So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 5 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 20 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait.THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. Titanfall is incredible by the way!Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.Xbox 360 had the best controller by far, almost tie with PS3 controller. There was nothing better that I could ask for. Guess what, it got better. Xbox has been making a big deal out of the D-pad. It is true that it functions much better, but it wasn't worth making such a big deal about. The Bumpers on the controller are a little bit annoying. They take some getting used to because they are positioned slightly differently and make a very loud and annoying sound. The thumbsticks are smaller which is somewhat better and also have the edges a little tighter which keeps it from tearing like it did on my 360 controller. The positioning of the home button is much better in that it doesn't get in the way of the buttons. When my Dad plays, he might hit the center of the 360 button in the middle of the game, but this controller helps avoid that from happening. Overall it is similar to the 360 controller and I believe it is easy to get use to the new layout within a day or two. 4.6/5Now this is an ugly great looking Xbox, not so much as the 360 or PS4 but that was kind of expected now wasn't it. The upside to this is that we will not have to go through the horrible red ring of death. It is capable of keeping cool and will not overheat even if on for 24 hours straight for every day, I would know. I'm sure within 2 or 3 years we will have a redesigned Xbox that is smaller, just like how the Xbox slim was released. Another upside is that the Xbox is very quiet which is quite surprising given the size and consumption of it. The system is way quieter then the older two xbox systems or the PS2, and PS3. thank God with the fact that there is no more red ring of death.Well the Xbox is constantly recording the last 5 minutes of gameplay so you can easily record anything, either automatically or with a voice command. Unfortunately I have been having trouble with the voice command so I have been stuck having to do it manually. Sharing videos with friends is very easy thanks to this. Hopefully people will reduce the uploads of there uninteresting videos and keep it restricted to only the ones worth watching. 3.9/5[Movies] Finally a blu-ray player, I have been wanting this for many years. Although I already had one in my living room, I could really use one in my basement. Sometimes you just want to watch a movie by yourself without being disturbed or by disturbing others, this is why this came in handy. Now that I get almost all my movies either streaming or Blu-ray, the Xbox is my number 1 movie player. It is true that you have to download an app to play the blu-ray, but it's free and easy.[Kinect] Well, well, well, so you add a Kinect Microsoft and you bump up the cost 100 bucks more than the PS4?... NO PROBLEM! I am not disappointed at all. The Kinect is amazing; 10 times better than the old kinect. I can say anything and the kinect will do it with ease. Also, almost all games have at least some kinect functionality. Battlefield lets you turn your head in order to turn your head in battlefield when in a vehicle which is really cool. FIFA allows subs to be made just by saying it which is also cool. As time goes on, I feel that the kinect will be more and more useful in these games. In the end, this is a great addition to the Xbox. 4.6/5With everything the Xbox has to offer, there is no other thing I would rather have. I give it a 5 out of 5 for now, but I think I will rank it higher as time goes by if that were possible. It has been great for everything, mainly gaming with revolutionary graphics. And remember, it can only get better from here. Also I remember when my 360 died of red ring of death, and went with the PS3 glad I made the move but this shows that XBox is where it is really at. So if you are still on the fence and can not get both PS4 and Xbox One go with the Xbox One it really is I feel the better of the two even though I will be getting the PS4 which is great also.\"]\n",
            " [\"I've been using this mouse for awhile and unlike other people who have reviewed this mouse I am going to compare it to the G500, not the G700.The Sensei is a solid mouse but lacks the weight options of the G500. In fact while I used the G500 I added as much weight as I could and was used to how it moved. Switching to the Sensei took a little bit of getting used to but after a couple days it felt good.I like that it's wireless compared to the G500, and if you forget to cradle the Sensei to charge it, or have an extremely long play session unhooking the cord from the base and into the mouse makes it a wired option which is very nice for forgetful people like me.With software that you download from the SteelSeries website all the buttons are fully programmable, in fact you can program the buttons for different games and switch between those presets as you switch games which is also a very nice touch.Why the 4 Star rating then if I have nothing but good things to say you may be asking. Simple, do a lot of video editing and as such use the mouse extensively. The problem I have with this one is where the &#34;forward&#34; button is located and how low of profile it has. It makes it difficult to feel where it is, much less consistently press it when needed.It has a myriad of color options available for customization via the software. It's nice but really only useful for helping to monitor battery life.Overall I really like this mouse, it would be near perfect if those side buttons had a slightly different layout and a higher profile. As it is right now I can only say it's a very good option.\"]\n",
            " [\"This is really cool mouse with some incredible software options, which I've been using for a few weeks now, playing my MMOs. While I do play FPS games, it's on consoles. (Don't hate! Someone's gotta keep Sony in business. ;).  You can change everything from the power save settings to the DPI, acceleration, lift-off distance, and of course all the LED colors. One cool thing you can do with the LEDs in both the mouse and the charging dock is set them so they will show you what you're mouse's battery life is. So as it goes down, it goes from green when fully changed, through the colors of yellow, orange and red as is loses it's charge.The charging dock is used for both charging the mouse and as the mouse's wireless receiver. So there isn't an additional piece needed to take up yet another USB port. But you'll want to keep that in mind for desk space. The charging dock is actually one of the nicest parts to this set. The mouse drops into it easily and the colors glow on it really well. It has a slip resistant backing too, so it doesn't move around on you.The option to use this as a wired or wireless mouse is outstanding. I've been using the mouse mostly wirelessly since I got it and it's been incredibly responsive. However I will say if I was playing something as intense a FPS in online multiplayer with this mouse, I'd probably end up choosing to use the wired option. Anything to get that extra edge, even if it's just an extra millisecond.  But that's easy enough to do since you just remove the USB cable from the back of the charging dock and plug it into the mouse to create a wired connection. This is also handy in case you're using the mouse wirelessly and the battery goes dead. You can just plug it in and start using it again.The mouse design and build quality is going to be one of those things that each person will either love or hate. It's really light weight and it's not covered in all sorts of various ergonomic and cool looking angles like some other gaming mice brands are. However for certain types of gaming, having a light weight mouse is essential or preferred. So to one person it might feel cheap, to another it's a must-have feature. And the simplistic and smooth design allows it to work with all sizes of hands, and also those who are right handed and those who are left handed.This is an awesome mouse, loaded with customization options in the software and works great as both a  wired and wireless mouse. However it's price right now at launch is steep. What makes it stand apart from so many other gaming mice is the choice to use it wired or wirelessly, and I'm not sure that alone is enough to make it worth all the extra money. It may however be for some. For everyone else, I'd suggest waiting for it to come down some in price to a more comparable match to other gaming mice of similar quality. You'll like it a whole lot more that way.\"]\n",

A lot of money here is going into build quality and fancy little extras that are nice to have, but not critical by any means.It feels very solid in my hands. It's not my favorite shape, but mouse shape is more personal preference than something to objectively judge on. Being able to use it as both a wired and wireless device is very nice, and its glowing charging dock is also very well built and a nice touch. The ability to change the color of the glow and how it pulses is a nice little extra, but hardly the kind of thing that's going to make or break anyone's day. Using the color to indicate charge level at a glance is a good use of the technology, though.For most people, this is way too much money to spend to get a few features that aren't exactly going to revolutionize the way you use a computer. The glowing and customization of the buttons is nice. It's a very well built luxury item.\"]\n",
            " [\"I'm another one who can't help the need to compare this to my Logitech G700.In use, I don't find any find any practical difference between the performance of the two mice. However, in shape, the G700 fits my hand much better than the Sensei. The Sensei's shape simply emulates any standard cheap mouse, where the G700's form fitting design really provides comfort to my hand.I like the charging station. I often forget to plug a cable into my G700 at night, and therefore occasionally wind up using it as a corded mouse. With the Sensei, you're naturally going to rest it in the charging station when not in use.I don't like that the charging station connects to the computer with a USB cable. I'd rather the communication come with a dongle and the charging station plug into power. Power cables I can put out of my way. Cables going to the computer are an occasional nuisance.I like the operation of the scroll wheel on the Sensei slightly better than on the G700, which seems a bit more &#34;loose&#34;.As mentioned in my title, there is really no documentation with this device. There is a fold out pamphlet with picture diagrams ... some of which were obvious and some that I had to puzzle over. So while there are (presumably) game programmable buttons on the sides, I have no idea what they are doing, if they will automatically do that, or so forth. The driver does not supply a System Tray interface as the G700 does, so there is nothing for me to poke around to explore and figure out, either. I might be able to find a web site to explain this stuff to me, but who wants to dig around for the manufacturer's web site to learn about a product you have in hand? If you do, great. I don't.Finally, I recently got a G700 to replace a previous G500. I got it on an Amazon daily deal for less than a third of what the Sensei costs. Think about that. Catch it on special and you can have THREE G700s for the price of one Sensei.The Sensei claims a 1ms response time, which is the same that the G700 claims. Both claim 8200 DPI precision (although for some reason the Sensei promo information calls it CPI).So for the lower price, better documentation, easier to find and use utility software, better ergonometric style, and convenience of a dongle to the computer rather than a USB cable, I'm switching right back to my G700.\"]\n",
            " ['The Steel Series Sensei wireless mouse is a work of art that works flawlessly under all situations.  You get a customized lit charging-transmitter platform that plugs into a USB port and the \"palm\" type customizable colorful (and adorable) mouse in the package.Under Windows 7, drivers were immediately available and the mouse was available.  The downloaded Steel Series software provide customization options including movement speed, precision, and even movement curves in addition to control over the more artsy aspects of color and lighting for the charging platform and mouse.  There are multiple options that will make this mouse your own!The Sensei can be hard wired if you prefer but it really is unnecessary even for gaming since the wireless functionality feels hard wired.  The reason for this is that Steel Series chose to make the USB battery charging stand the transmitter rather than rely on blue tooth.  Repeat:  No blue tooth!  There is no lag time at all with this set up.Playing Borderlands 2 and Bioshock Infinite showed that this mouse is ready for action.  While this user prefers a slower mouse, at about 1500 BCPI, the Sensei can range up to a blazing 16,500 BCPI.  Movement is quick, consistent, and with no hesitation.  Being wireless you never fight with the cord.While this is a great mouse, it would be nice if it would stay on continuously with no time out.  The maximum time out is 20 minutes, and when you come back to your computer, you have to turn the mouse over to reset the connection (turning the mouse off and then back on).  This is a minor inconvenience but still if someone chooses to leave it (charging) on the stand, why would there be a need for a time out?In short, while expensive, this mouse is a functional work of art that will make your normal day to day computer tasks and gaming easy while complementing your desktop with eye candy.Edit 06-06-14:  Discovered that when the mouse goes into stand-by you do not have to turn it off and on to wake it up.  Pressing both left and right buttons at the same time will wake it up!']\n",

Before you start, make sure to download SteelSeries software on their website as there is no disk included.Controls and reaction time of each click is top-notch and precise.  This mouse is also very comfortable to use and click, as it has several side controls.  There was no issues with scrolling either.Macro function is also very handy as it is easy to program a series of actions and assign it to any click.  Again, download a free SteelSeries software on their site to take advantage of all features.You have 2 options:  Wired or wireless.  Either connect a braided(nice touch) USB cable to a charging cradle or directly to your mouse.  Cradle can have its separate color scheme as well.  However, there is one annoyance about this mouse that makes me grind my teeth: Its inconsistency and very short \"time-out\" when not in use.  If you come back to use your computer, after a while you literally have to switch the mouse OFF and ON again by doing so underneath the mouse.  Apparently \"Sensei\" likes to test my patience.  Surely this may not be an issue if you only use this mouse for strictly gaming, but I\\'m sure most people will not have separate mice for other computer tasks.Don\\'t get me wrong though as this is still one of the best and stylish peripherals that I have ever used and SteelSeries really do know their way with gaming products.

            " ['A few days before getting this mouse I was commenting how gaming mice have gone from wired to wireless and back to wired again. And I wondered out loud  why no one produced a gaming mouse that can be both. I envisioned a mouse where a chord can be plugged in to use it wired or to charge the mouse or without as a wireless mouse.The first thing I noticed on unpacking the Steelseries Sensei was that it has this very option &#61514;It looks expensive and sophisticated with its metal charging station and fairly minimalist ambidextrous mouse design.  But compared to most of the competition there are not too many buttons so initially it may seem like it doesn&#8217;t have many features.  However, as you quickly discover, that isn&#8217;t the case.Docking/Charging stationThis steelseries mouse comes with an attractive charging station where you can place the mouse when not in use to let it charge. It is attractive and the beveled silver top is actually made of brushed steel that shouts quality. A glowing halo outlines the shape of the mouse and circles the inset space where the mouse sits snug for charging. The illumination is fully configurable, by default it is green and fades through orange green to orange through to red depending on the status of the battery in the mouse.The USB cord has a braided cloth sleeve and  is a micro usb to regular USB type that can be plugged into either the docking bay or directly into the mouse itself to provide power.It is a tiny connector but not as fragile as say a phone one. The plug and socket on the mouse and charger are slotted and the plug slides in and locks into place. So it won&#8217;t wear or break easily despite the small size.The MouseThe mouse itself is an ambidextrous design that you cup in your palm rather than a claw grip. It has a rubber coated scroll wheel that is scroll only and does not have left to right movements (Not a big deal because in Windows, the default setting lets you press the scroll button to toggle panning of the screen both up down and left to right.) This does make the wheel very precise for scrolling and it feels solid when you press it as a button. The wheel has a very smooth friction with no play so it feels very good.The main left and right mouse buttons are seamlessly hidden in the smooth body of the mouse and feel very precise with a muted click when pressed that sounds less intrusive than some.  Centered behind the scroll wheel is a single button for changing the CPI (sensitivity). You can set two different sensitivity settings and toggle between them at any time with this button. Eg., Toggle between fast movement for general looking around in a game and slow smooth movements for precision shooting or if you&#8217;re doing photoshop precise pixel manipulation.On each side of the mouse you have two buttons. So a total of four extra buttons. This is really two fully useable buttons since the ambidextrous design means that unless you have a very dexterous pinkie finger you probably won&#8217;t use the two buttons on one side often.The mouse itself is quite light. It has an integrated battery which brings the weight down even compared to my last wireless mouse that only had a single AA battery.The software/drivers for PC and MacThe mouse does not come with a CD included so you have to download the Steelseries 3 engine software from their website at:[...]Their software is very stylish and presented in a very elegant manner with intuitive interactive diagrams for controlling.Sensitivity setting #1Sensitivity setting #2Battery life savingSleep timerSensor smart modeIllumination smart modeAcceleration/DecelerationLift distanceAngle SnappingPolling RateThere are various button profile programming options.You also have full control of the illumination of the LED&#8217;s on the base and mouse logo through all it&#8217;s 16 million colors.Individual preset/profiles can be stored separately and can be automatically backed up on to the free online cloud service steelseries provides their users. Great if you use multiple computers or game away from home like at lan parties.In use.The mouse is very comfortable cupped in your hand. The sensor is rated at 8200cpi which can be doubled through interpolation in the driver software.  The switches for the buttons are rated for 30 million clicks. They sound quieter with a duller more subdued click than other mice I have tried, a mellower sound which I think is nice and doesn&#8217;t intrude so much if you don&#8217;t like noise pollution.You can use it as a wired or wireless mouse. I see no reason to use it wired when the polling rate is up to 1ms response time in both wireless and wired mode.The mouse glides very smoothly over my cloth G series gaming mouse mat. It fits nicely in my hand and has a pleasant, slightly rubberized feel . It is very precise and responsive. With my ongoing carpel tunnel problems in my right arm, the ambidextrous design allows me to switch hands and use it comfortably in my left hand and rest the bad one. In games it also allows me to use it for looking around with my left hand while using a joystick in my right hand when controlling sim type games.I have used a Microsoft and Genius gaming mouse that were left or right handed and this is easily the best.Is it worth the price. If you are left handed, there is a limited choice of responsive lag free ambidextrous gaming mice and this is the best I have used. So if you can stretch your budget this is a good option.  It&#8217;s also attractive and offers a fairly unique look that stands out from the crowd. It looks well designed and just looks and feels like a well thought out  quality product.I highly recommend it.']\n",
            " [\"I wasn't sure I was going to like this mouse given that I've been completely spoiled by all the extra buttons on my Razer Naga. That said, however, this mouse is by far the best for any game that doesn't require the extra buttons that the Naga offers. The battery lasts longer than any gaming mouse I've ever owned, and recharging is so ridiculously simple. I love the charging base and not having to switch cords around to switch from wired to wireless. With the battery life on this mouse, I can play for hours without having to worry about it dying, and then just plop it on the charging base to ensure it's full and ready to go the next time I play. I never have to use the wire as a back up when the battery dies suddenly and unexpectedly. Love!!The mouse is also just the right weight, not too light but not too heavy. Just enough to keep your hand from tiring but still have precise movement. The shape is also very ergonomic and hand cramps have yet to be experienced here, even after several hours of playing. The mouse and base just look beautiful, too. I don't buy gaming products for how cool they look as I prioritize performance above aesthetics, but I won't lie, they are very nice to look at. The ability to change any color of the rainbow is also very much welcomed. More mice are doing this these days, but it's still nice to have a wide range of colors to choose from with an interface that is intuitive and easy to use on all fronts.My favorite feature, which goes right along with the battery life, is the auto sleep function. After 15 minutes without activity, it goes to sleep to preserve the battery. A simple click of any of the buttons wakes it up, but this is very nice for preserving that already epic battery life. Well done, SteelSeries!\"]\n",

So far, my accuracy in a few games has improved. The mouse is very precise, scary precise. The charger it rests in when it is taking a nap is super sleek. I am suprised Apple or Microsoft hasn't snapped up this company. In windows 8, this mouse works great. Just plug and play and your good. Yes, the negative is that you can go out and buy a brand new Xbox 360 or PS3 for the price of this mouse which is crazy to think about, but in reality, you really use your mouse more right?

            " ['We\\'re a very avid gaming household who tend to buy and cycle through a lot of different mice, so we\\'re always on the lookout to try something new. I generally use a standard 5 to 6 button mouse for most games but for MMO\\'s and FPS\\' I prefer a mouse with more buttons to better customize my play style. When I saw this mouse I thought it would be the perfect item to test out and review. Here are my thoughts on the SteelSeries Sensei Wireless Laser Gaming Mouse;Pros+ Textured rubber sides help keep your hand on the mouse even during the most frantic gameplay.+ Non-sweat surface is smooth while offering a good grip and is easy to clean.+ Steel Series logo and scroll wheel LED\\'s illuminate a nice soft multicolor glow without heating up. They also have multiple levels of brightness and different lighting effects to choose from.+ Perfect mouse size makes it easily usable by both small and large hand types.+ Mouse lays flat in the charging base creating a perfect connection.+ Instantly adjust your DPI with the click of a button.+ Illuminated charging base notifies you when the mouse is beginning to lose power.+ Comfortable ergonomic design usable by both left and right handers.+ Usable as both wired and wireless.+ Quick and easy installation.+ Smooth glide movement.+ Lightweight construction.+ 8 programmable buttons.+ Quiet scroll wheel.+ Sleek design and simple look.Cons- Mouse uses Steelseries Engine 3.  If you have another Steelseries device that uses Steelseries Engine 2 it\\'s incompatible with Engine 3 which forces you to run two different programs to customize your key binds and lighting effects.  For example I have theSteelSeries Apex Gaming Keyboardwith which I ran into this problem.- Non-standard USB plug on the head of the mouse so you can\\'t just use any random USB cord.- Quite expensive with a list price of $159.99 and the overall construction feels a little cheap.- For a FPS player this mouse is great, but for an avid MMO player I feel it lacks buttons compared to many other gaming mice on the market.- No left-right click on the scroll wheel.- May be a bit too light for some users.The \"SteelSeries Sensei Wireless Laser Gaming Mouse\" is a solid and well designed mouse aimed towards the gamer but still usable by all. I actually began using this mouse at work as it has just the right amount buttons for my daily desk routine. Overall, the mouse has a comfortable ergonomic shape, numerous buttons and incredible accuracy. However, I do feel that this gaming mouse is better suited for the FPS player over an active MMO player due to its lack of buttons. The \"SteelSeries Sensei Wireless Laser Gaming Mouse\" is a respectable multi-functional gaming mouse which should please most average players while being equally functional for everyday use.  My only real gripe is the high retail.  However, if you\\'re willing to drop the extra cash for this mouse chances are you won\\'t be disappointed.']\n",
            " [\"( I am comparing this to my Logitech G700 wireless gaming mouse after playing BF4 PC for about 5-6 hours)Setup - 10/10Out of the box, the Sensei was a perfect setup experience from start to finish, and I didn't feel I needed to adjust the default movement settings one bit on either my Mac or PC. No RTFM required.Charging - 10/10I love the docking charger - its not just another unconnected USB cable, and encourages me to use the mouse wirelessly all the time as I *want* to take a second to dock it before ending a session - vs the G700, where I feel I might as well plug it in to get better connectivity and keep it charged.Performance: 10/10Its obviously incredibly difficult to compare the tracking/latency between two top-tier wireless gaming mice - both perform great, but I do *feel* the Sensei may be better - its absolutely as good as or better. I didn't feel the need to plug it into USB for lower latency at all. I pretty much always have my G700 plugged in, but its not that I *know* its better, its more psychological.Price: 6/10You can definitely make an argument for the *relative* value over G700 just with that awesome charging base and performance, but the price is just crazy for a mouse. If they were priced the same, the Sensei would be the clear winner. This is where it lost a star.The software for button programming seems fine and has a Mac version which is nice - but I don't typically use this feature.I don't know if I will stick with Sensei over the G700 for the simple reason that I prefer the G700's height - it allows my palm to rest on it, while with the Sensei, I have to keep it raised a bit as its a lower slope in the front. This is totally personal preference so I didn't take a star for it.  In both cases, I still miss the adjustable weights in the G500.\"]\n",
            " [\"I have tried many different types of mice for the PC, both wired and wireless. This one is the best I have ever used. It's a solid product with ease of use in almost all of its extra features. The basic expected features to be able to assign mouse buttons and change the ranges for speed and accuracy all work well.The software I downloaded from the SteelSeries site updated without an issue and the software operated with this mouse beautifully.The lights are configurable, which is a pretty cool feature.The middle scroll-wheel is perfect. Is rubber so its tactile sense is very good to enable ease of control. Its clicks value is adjustable.What I liked best is being able to configure the speed of the mouse as I move it across the screen and its accuracy. I played multiple 3D games as well as worked in 3D software plus just did normal workflow. Arguably, the everyday activities needs its own settings to prevent the necessary quickness and accuracy in a 3D shooter, for example. This is possible through being able to save different configurations.3D games I tried without a hitch and with excellent flow and movement:Battlefield 4Far Cry 3Hitman AbsolutionI didn't have one issue, except one - the mouse goes to sleep after 15 minutes (default setting) of inactivity and I didn't figure this out right away. Basically, all I needed to do is click the mouse once and it woke up; then I could move the mouse cursor.One very good thing about this setup is that it can be wired or wireless. Both work well. This is a gamer / geek's dream come true.Finally, this mouse immediately started to feel natural, like I didn't need to think about it. Not only my hand, but the way it was moving with what I was doing became very easy.\"]\n",
            " [\"In about a month of using the SteelSeries Sensei on my main gaming/productivity custom PC it has quickly become my favorite mouse in quite some time. The Sensei replaced a wired SteelSeries Kana gaming mouse that I've been using for the past several years and is light years ahead of that mouse.--------------------DESIGN:The Sensei is pretty straightforward as far as gaming mice go. Aesthetically the Sensei likely has more in common with far cheaper run-of-the-mill mice than some of the more radical designs by companies like Corsair, Logitech, and Razr. This can be a good or bad thing depending on the user. My current build is more subdued and I find that the subdued looks of the Sensei readily compliment my components including the Corsair K95 keyboard.However, the biggest drawback here is that some of the ergonomic features in other mice (G700 or M65) are absent in the Sensei. The biggest absent feature would probably be the thumb-rest those two mice feature but also the overall shape which is probably a bit more refined than the traditional shape of the Sensei.The Sensei consists of two major components: the base (which doubles as the power charger) and the mouse itself. The base is connected to the PC via an included USB cable. The Sensei is Plug-and-Play compliant, however, I strongly recommend downloading the SteelSeries Engine 3 software from SteelSeries' website: [...]SteelSeries Engine 3 is what really sets the Sensei off from just being another neat looking peripheral. Engine 3 detects any SteelSeries components and displays them in a neatly organized library under the 'My Gear' tab. Clicking on the Sensei a new window opens displaying the mouse and all of the adjustments that can be made. There is a lot of customization that can be done and I'll do my best to capture that in the next section ('software')The mouse buttons are well designed. The left and right main buttons sit flush with the mouse surface. The scroll-wheel features a nice rubber-type of surface coating and increment-evident scrolling. Four button are built into the sides of the mouse with two on each side.--------------------SOFTWARE:As I said before there is a lot of customization to the Sensei using the Engine 3 software. CPI (or Count's Per Inch) as opposed to what most companies call it - DPI (or Dots Per Inch) is the most basic adjustment. Two CPI profiles can be saved and toggled with the click of mouse button 8 (top-most button on the mouse). This is great for switching CPI on the fly between regular use and say a specific game where more CPI is advantageous.Each button is assigned a section in Engine 3 and is readily programmable using the included macro editor tool.Another neat feature is the illumination customization options to both the base/charger and the mouse itself. These can be customized using a standard RGB configuration tool or specific color codes. Out of the box the base is assigned to display the battery status profile (green = fully charged, amber = half-charged and so on). The color of the SteelSeries logo on the mouse itself can be changed independently of the base. Illumination can also be completely switch off.Other adjustments:Acceleration/Deceleration: Consider this a fine tuning adjustment beyond the assigned CPI profile. Based on a users input (quick or slow movements) you can further customize the mouse CPI for additional sensitivity.Lift Distance: You can customize how far you can lift your mouse from your surface and still register movement.Angle Snapping: This setting will help straighten lines (left or right movement).Polling Rate: How often (in Hz) the mouse and computer communicate. A setting of 1000 will set the polling rate at every 1 millisecond.--------------------USE:I've been using the Sensei for about a month and absolutely love this mouse. Even my wife who's been occasionally using my PC (for the dual monitors) for an online study program loved the mouse. I've used the Sensei in everything from shooters (Battlefield 4) to playing slower paced games (Skyrim) and Diablo 3 and the performance is outstanding. Being able to switch to custom macro setups and CPI is a breeze.I'm also happy to say that after some long play sessions my hand did not feel fatigued.--------------------THE GOOD:(+) The Sensei is well built and coupled with the Engine 3 software is really quite a powerful mouse and perfect for those that want a high degree of customization(+) Excellent styling and aesthetics(+) Perfect for gaming but also not so far out there that it's difficult to use in everyday applications(+) Excellent battery life even if left off the charger for a night or two(+) Can be used in wired mode if so desired (and includes a locking mechanism to keep the mini-USB cable locked to the mouse--------------------WHAT COULD BE BETTER:(-) The price point for this device is sky-high(-) The weight of the mouse is good (120 grams) but no option to add/remove weight like in other premium mice--------------------CONCLUSION:If you're looking for a spectacular performing wireless gaming mouse that you wouldn't be embarrassed to use outside of your gaming room and price is no object then definitely check out the Sensei. Unfortunately the price will probably keep most folks away from this product. Otherwise this is an easy recommendation.\"]\n",
            " [\"Ok first of all when I got this to review I wondered what in the world could make a mouse be worth $160.My current mouse is a Logitech G7 and I have always been happy with it, but the Sensei is on a whole new level, I am just not sure if it's on a level that justifies the price.I am not a gamer anymore, but I do use my PC for a lot of photo editing and work on schematic diagrams and the Sensei is a huge leap forward in these areas.  The mouse is precise, you can tailor it to work exactly how you want it. from acceleration to deceleration to various dpi levels that let you get in right on top of that pixel and do what you want. No more nudging to the left and right trying to get on target, the Sensei makes it all seamless and easy.What I Like:1) Very precise responsive mouse.  I don't think you will find any mouse that is this responsive to small movements.2) Smooth glide movement on the mouse pad3) Buttons are great, with a very good positive click.  The scroll wheel is great, no play in it at all.4) Feels good in the hand with one caveat.  The ambidextrous nature of this mouse means for me a righty I am always bouncing the right side button with my thumb.  Simple fix, if you don't need it disable it in the software.5) Base charger is a super well made piece of gear, the Aluminum finish is great,  it has a feel of very high quality.6) You can configure this mouse till the cows come home.7) Battery life under normal daily use is about 3-4 days for me and the battery indicator mode works pretty good.8) Battery saving modes are well thought out. The capacitive touch sensor on the body of the mouse can turn off the Leds when your hand is on it, and the auto sleep mode works really well.What I don't like (hence 4 stars not 5)1) The construction of the mouse itself while great does not feel like what I figured a $160 mouse would feel like.  It's a pity they did not use the same quality construction that they used on the charging base.  Don't get me wrong this is miles ahead of a G7 in that it's half the weight and still feels solid, but for that money it feels like it needs something more to justify the price.2) The 16 million color stuff is really very gimmicky.  There is really only one practical use for the lights and that is setting it to the battery indicator mode.  Every other mode is just bling!3) No real Manual...  It took me a few hours to figure everything out.  It need better documentation.What I liked and disliked at the same time:1) The Locking USB connector is great if you get caught with dead batteries and want to use it as a corded mouse.  The downside is that the connector is proprietary and if it breaks the user has to wait for a replacement.My Message to Steelseries LLC.You have a great product but you need to change the Leds on the front.  Ditch the 16 million color stuff and setup the Leds like an analog wrist watch style gauge. I would much rather see a gauge showing me more precise battery capacity level than just have a few levels of color change on an Icon.\"]\n",

Fortunately, you have the ability to install a easy to use management program that makes changing settings a breeze.Overall, I could not recommend this mouse enough.  With both wired and wireless options and a comfortable design, you can't go wrong choosing this one.\"]\n",
            " [\"most gaming mice are wired. Serious gamers don't want to deal with latency, lags or dying batteries. I've owned several SteelSeries wired mice so I can affirm that they always have a high build quality. This mouse is no exception. The charging base/wireless base transmitter for this mouse is very heavy and sturdy. You simple set the mouse on the stand to charge it. The mouse itself performs very well.  As a bonus this is also an ambidextrous mouse. Overall I'm fairly impressed. I do wish the battery life was better and a few times I had odd keyboard entries happen when the battery got low.  But the performance is impressive and the mouse is very comfortable.\"]\n",
            " ['I must be honest. I haven\\'t had the *best* experience with SteelSeries mice in the past. Some dodgy build construction and software left me wanting, so when a mouse comes along costing as much as the Sensei Wireless Laser Gaming Mouse does, it had better be good.Pros:1.) Simple as anything (anything simple!) to set up. Plug the included (braided) micro USB cable into mouse (for wired), or dock (for wireless) usage.2.) The dock is a very solid affair, by far the nicest part of the package.3.) Excellent response times. Feels easily as good as my Logitech G700s in terms of latency, - perhaps even a tad better... It can\\'t be overstated how well this mouse responds wirelessly.4.) Software is simple to configure, on an application-basis or just a system-wide configuration.5.) Very quiet scroll wheel.6.) While the light-show from the mouse and dock is pretty cool, they can both be disabled *mostly* completely (I can\\'t seem to disable the light in the scroll wheel, which pulses). On a side-note, it\\'s pretty cool that the mouse has some kind of sensor that knows when your hand is on it, and can shut the light off at that point. Neat!7.) Surprisingly light considering it has a battery - and a long-lasting one at that.8.) Easy-to-clean scroll wheel. My Logitech G700s accumulates all kinds of grit in the tiny grooves in the wheel that are a nuisance to remove, so this is a nice change.Cons:1.) Not very portable. You have to use the dock as the wireless receiver, so if you need to take your mouse somewhere and want to be wireless, the dock has to come, too. Or at the very least the cable it came with so you can use the mouse wired.2.) If your mouse battery runs out of juice, you\\'ll need to unplug the cable from the dock and plug it into the Sensei Wireless itself. Normally I\\'d say just keep an extra micro USB cable lying around, but they won\\'t fit due to the exceptionally narrow cable plastic to plug it in. I have plenty of extra micro USB cables lying around, and none fit!3.) The scroll wheel doesn\\'t click left or right, which in this day and age of gaming mice seems like an oversight.4.) Ambidextrous mice tend to mean they don\\'t really fit anyone all that well. The Sensei Wireless is comfortable, but not as comfortable as a G700s.5.) The DPI button on the top is a pain to press, so you\\'ll need to contort your index finger to get to it when you need to.6.) The left and right mouse buttons are spread just a tad too far apart, with a fairly large plastic area in the middle. Compared to my Logitech G700s, this means I need to keep my fingers spread just a little further apart than I\\'d like. I wish SteelSeries had taken the G700s approach, with the left/right mouse buttons wrapping more closely around the scroll wheel.7.) If you\\'re right-handed, the right-side custom buttons will be utterly useless to you (and vice versa if you\\'re left-handed). This really means that for actual gaming the easily accessible buttons you\\'ll have access to are left click/right click/scroll-wheel-click and the two left-side buttons. That\\'s not a whole lot of buttons - for a whole lot of money.8.) Slightly questionable coating on the docking station. I have a few areas where the mouse sits that light is bleeding through a little.9.) The software can be a little finicky. While it works fine when it works, I\\'ve already had to re-install it once in Windows 7 because the application refused to open. One other review mentioned this, and I can confirm it happened to me.10.) The scroll-wheel, while really quiet, is a tad stiffer than I\\'d like, especially by comparison to the G700s. It can also get \"caught\" between the ratchet points, which feels weird when it happens.11.) The side parts are glossy plastic, which I don\\'t care for. Just feels slimy...12.) The top surface, while a matte finish, does tend to pick up grease/fingerprints all too easily. The G700s does none of these things.13.) You may find the G700s more comfortable. I know I do. There\\'s a small issue with the way the Sensei mouse buttons are designed. On the G700s, the mouse buttons do not go out to the very edge of the mouse. There\\'s a frame in which the mouse buttons are placed. On the Sensei the buttons do go out to the edge of the mouse (they look like they have a glossy frame, but the glossy frame is actually part of the mouse buttons themselves). The problem with this is that my ring ringer rests on the edge of the mouse, as it should. That means, though, when I right click with my middle finger, the right mouse button rubs against the edge of my ring finger (it\\'s basically trapping my ring finger\\'s skin like catching your finger in a door..). I do find this annoying, and think it\\'s an actual design flaw with the mouse.14.) No way to replace the internal battery.15.) That price.While it sounds like a laundry list of things that are bad about the Sensei, it\\'s a decent mouse. It looks great, feels reasonably nice  in the hand (for an ambi mouse) and the dock is so very convenient to drop the mouse into at the end of a long clicking day.The biggest problem is that the Logitech G700s exists, and is a fraction of the price. Logitech\\'s software isn\\'t great (SteelSeries\\' is much *cleaner* looking - when it works), but with the G700s you do get a dedicated, more comfortable right-hand setup with easier to access buttons on the left side (and more of them!). And, you can replace the battery!For you lefties out there, though, take a good look at this SteelSeries. If you can get past the price, it\\'s not bad.3.5 out of 5.']\n",

By then you might not even care to play anymore.  I payed for the digital version so I got away with $20 only.  People are complaining of the future style of it and it not being so dark and gritty.  But really it means the graphics are better and more divers.  There's ice levels and beach levels.  Trees and just more color.  It's refreshing and I like it.  There are still dark levels with fire and such.  So it's not like your missing that.  They just have other levels that are at the beach with sand and simply more diversity.  The extreme tracks are hard as ever.  I do have a complaint that all the hard ones seem to be just different versions of each other.  You get past one and it feels like you are at it again with the next one.  So it feels like you never got past it at all.  I'd like to see more differences from obstacle to obstacle.  Also one achievement didn't unlock for me but I looked online and it doesn't seem to of happened to other people.  All in all this is a great game.  I'd say get the $20 version.  You can upgrade later for the same price and wait when the content is actually available.  Everyone should get this game.  If you've never played trials you'll love it and if you have you know exactly what your getting.  It's the same great game with a different environment style.  Graphics are brighter and more diverse.  If you've never played feel free to get the other games.  They have the same gameplay.  Nothing different game play wise accept for the new tricks you can do in fusion but it's nothing to write home about.  Getting over obstacles is still and always will be what trials is all about.  If you get the game you'll easily play for 10 hours minimum.  If you get into it at all you'll easily get beyond 20 hours.  Plenty of tracks to keep trying to get better times on and some you may never get gold.  Great value for $20 and if your a big fan that will play for a year $40 is a steal.

However, this game is not as good as its predecessor, Trials Evolution, which is why I give it 4 stars.My beefs with this game are:1.  Too much space-age stuff, and since it's a lot of smooth surfaces it sometimes makes the futuristic environments look bland.2.  Annoying commentary while driving.  Not bad on your first playthrough, but if you're playing on a difficult track or trying to get a really good run, you get sick of hearing the announcer say the same crap over and over, especially if you keep faulting.  It adds annoyance to frustration.  However, you can turn this feature off.3.  They went overboard with the difficulty on the extreme tracks.  Sounds like a weird complaint, extreme is extreme, right?  I loved extreme tracks on previous games due to the challenge, and most jumps on those games' tracks were skill based, not gimmicky jumps you had to get exactly perfectly right, as in Trials Fusion.  To illustrate my skill with Trials, I was consistently in the top 1% of the 1.8 million+ person leaderboard on Trials Evolution, and had beaten all but 1 of the dozens of extreme tracks from Trials HD, Trials Evolution, and all their DLC's combined, and had Gold medals on all the extreme tracks in Trials Evolution, so I'm pretty good.  Now to illustrate the difficulty spike in Fusion's extreme tracks, In Trials Fusion have only beaten 2 of the 5 Extreme tracks, after easily 3,000 to 4,000 faults on them combined, but still while getting gold medals on all other tracks in the game within 1 to 3 attempts.Regardless, still and excellent game, well worth the money.  However, I hope they chill out with really gimmicky jumps on the extreme tracks in the DLC, extreme isn't that fun anymore.\"]\n",
            " [\"My perspective for this review: I have played every Trials game...and I have loved them all.  Because of my loyalty I bought Trials Fusion for the Xbox One without thinking twice...and without doing any research...and as things turn out this was a mistake and I now feel cheated and ripped off (actually going to see if I can get my money back even though it was a digital download).  My issues so far with the game: 1) It doesn't feel quirky, cool and funny like the previous Trials games...now it feels kinda stiff and goofy.  2) Trials Fusion is an unfinished game...several features don't work...they show up in the menus, but say &#34;coming soon&#34;...this is LAME. 3) There is NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER...and the developers have the nerve to say that people didn't use multiplayer...well my friends and I loaded up online multiplayer races all the time and had a blast...no online multiplayer is VERY VERY LAME. 4) The career is ok...but just ok...the events go from too easy to very hard without much middle ground.  5) There is a +$5 Xbox One surcharge...this should still be a $15 game, but they are now charging $20...and for an incomplete game.  Overall I am just really disappointed with this game...sad to see it go downhill like this and lose its heritage and fun factor...also sad to see it was rushed to market without being finished.  Save your money for now...\"]\n",

I am not sure if there were server issues before that, but I experienced none of them. I have played the first two worlds so far and I enjoy it. It's a lot of the same Trials action as before.Good:-Trials is addictive fun with customization offered allowing infinite possibilities on future map developments.-Levels range from easy to hard as with the past games.-Arcade game feel still remains intact.-Game case actually includes an instruction manual (this is the first I've had in all of my Xbox One games!)Bad:-Camera angles follow more closely to Trials 2 than the original. I like the more static view as sometimes the following and turning camera can make it difficult to gauge an obstacle properly.-Early levels are more about long jumps and timing smooth landings instead of intricate jumps. I expect it to get harder, but one of the things that Trials left after the first one is the idea of a small level. I like the mix between super long jumps and smaller levels that make me feel like I'm in a warehouse or something.Overall, the game is good. The $40 release is worth it to me as this would have been an easy $20 for me to spend on the digital copy, but also includes a season pass to DLC. If you have no interest in DLC, then just download the game and save yourself some money. I am a little disappointed that they didn't include the original game on the disc, but that's not something I expected buying the game, just wishful thinking.I didn't give it a 5-star simply because of the camera angles.\"]\n",

If they had not killed off online Motocross, which I played 75% of the time, then I would give this 5 Stars.  They claimed nobody used the function, funny because most of the people I know loved it.After I play through all the trials tracks, which are really great, I will probably never use this again unless they offer an add-on pack with Motocross.  I will most likely go back to Trials Evolution for the foreseeable future.UPDATE 9July2014: The new \"multiplayer\" mode is not even close to true multiplayer.  You compete blindly against other people, and really have no idea how the competition is progressing in real time.  You simply see statistics, which for all you know could be random names spit out like AI.  This non-existent \"upgrade\" sounds like a way for them to avoid server costs.  I completed all but the last set of single player Trials tracks in under 2 hours, now it is a paperweight.  The new Freestyle mode is fun, but only six tracks which are much to easy to win.

            " [\"I initially balked at all the bad reviews I had been seeing about this game UNTIL I hit about levels 12-15 (a little bit before rescuing Roland) and started getting a little frustrated by a few things:- frame rate takes a noticeable dip, particularly during chaotic spots, making it more difficult to get oriented and make accurate shots when the turds hit the fan. Also walking around Sanctuary seems to be increasingly choppy.- lag also becomes more noticeable; moving between inventory screens, during some dialogue bits, dealing damage, and at various other spots.- the game has crashed on me FIVE times and given me an error message once. This was incredibly frustrating as I had either just gathered some real bada$$ gear, made some stellar kills, and/or made a ton of progress which was ALL lost. The only upside to this happening was that I somehow got extra tokens upon starting back up. Or at least that's what it seemed like.The default control layout takes a bit to get used to in the beginning but overall I'd say it's the most intuitive layout. Mostly I've found the front and rear pads to be responsive once I found the sweet spot, though I have on occasion gotten nailed because the sprint or melee controls on the back pad didn't respond on the first or second tap.Otherwise I've had a blast playing. I wouldn't say these things are deal breakers for me as I got my copy with the new Vita Slim but I might feel differently if I had paid $40 for it. Also, aside from the blatant crashing, the other stuff hasn't been SO annoying that I ever stopped playing because of it. Hope it doesn't get worse, though.BL2 is hilarious and ultimately really fun to play even if some other logistics were trimmed down to accommodate the port. It looks nice on the Vita and a really welcomed break from the smaller indie games- you can easily sink 100+ hours into this game. If you don't have it yet and think the bugs might annoy you I might wait to see if anything is done to address them.\"]\n",

            " [\"Borderlands 2 was the game that defied all odds and somehow was ported over to the Playstation Vita. Nobody really thought it would ever happen and once they found out it was going to happen, everyone became skeptical. Skeptics, you can now become believers because Borderlands 2 on the Playstation Vita is here, and it's bigger and better than we could have ever hoped for.For those of you who haven't played Borderlands 2 before, the story is pretty simple. You play as a Vault Hunter who is heavily under attack by the game's antagonist, Handsome Jack. Jack puts it about as simple as you can get at the very beginning of the game where he states &#34;Here's how things work, you, the Vault Hunter, finds the vault, and then gets killed, by me&#34;. The vault is basically a fancy way of saying &#34;Giant Treasure Chest&#34;. The story isn't really anything phenomenal, but the way it is told makes up for it big time. You will meet tons of insane characters along the way, most of which are a joy to do missions for thanks to incredible voice acting and absolutely hilarious writing.The gameplay is simple, but deep. Over the course of the main story you will go from having two guns at a time, to four. You will also be able to get shields, grenade mods, class mods, and other added bonuses along the way. So the way you play the game is completely up to you. There is a level cap at 50, which will take a while to get to (Usually around 50+ hours for the standard gamer) and with the 6 add ons included with the Vita, that cap is pushed to 61. Ever time you level up you get to add to your skill tree which depending on the character you play as, can drastically change how powerful you are. There are four character classes with two downloadable classes, one of which is bound to fit your play style perfectly whether you like to go in head first and unload all of your ammo at once, or stay back and take more of a stealth approach, it's completely up to you.Now, let's get onto the concerns this game has. At the time this review was posted, the average critic score is about 6.3. Most complaints are about technical issues thanks to the Vita. Let's put those rumors to rest. Yes, the frame rate dips here and there. No, the graphics aren't quite as good as it's PS3 counterpart. Yes, the controls are a bit awkward and will take some getting used to. But with all of that being said, none of that is a deal breaker. The frame rate holds up really well for most of the game and only dips slightly during times of high action, but it's still very easily playable throughout the entire campaign. The playstation 3 does have four more buttons that the Vita doesn't have, so they did have to use Touch controls to make up for it, it is kind of awkward but once you realize what you're playing, it just doesn't matter. And the graphics, GET OVER IT, this isn't a Playstation 3, you have in your hand, it's a Vita, plus they aren't even that bad, it's just the comparison between the two platforms isn't fair to any extent.Borderlands 2 on the Playstation Vita is the closest thing you will get to a full on console experience. The way that they were able to port this game over to the Vita with so few flaws is simply staggering. Don't listen to the critic reviews, they've overstated the technical issues so much it isn't fair. The day one patches are out now and it really makes a lot of those complaints obsolete. Now there are games that were made for the Playstation Vita (i.e. Killzone Mercenary, Uncharted: Golden Abyss) that might look better in comparison, but Borderlands 2 is hands down the best game you can buy for your Vita right now.FINAL SCORE: 9/10Pros.+ Hilarious Dialogue+ Excellent and Memorable Characters+ How You Play Is Completely Up To You+ Fantastic Shooting Elements+ Easy To Get Into, Hard To Put Down+ Six DLC Packs Included Free+ Tons Of Content For A Reasonably Low PriceCons.- Minor Technical Flaws\"]\n",

There is lag at times and controls take a bit to get used to but the gameplay is solid, I'd say this is a very good port. As I said, I don't see major graphical differences btw the PC version and this, none of them look like Crysis, IMO both look equally bad in terms of eye candy but this is still a must have given the scarcity of games for the Vita.\"]\n",

That said I've been a huge fan of other series on the console and I still panned their Vita ports.  I put a lot of hours into this so far and I wanted to contribute a little on what I found.  Borderlands turned out to be a pretty nice port all things considered but I think the reviews do hit on the key pros and cons.  Anyone who played the original release knows that this is a monster game, and while we were all stoked to hear this was coming out, there was no way they were going to be able to replicate this on the Vita.  In my opinion a fan would be able to look past these documented issues and find a really enjoyable game - I mean we now have a portable Borderlands!I'm ok with the sacrifices they made with the graphics and I have gotten used to the controls (with the exception of regularly chucking grenades when my right thumb lightly grazes the screen while moving).  I'm ok with the reduction in multiplayer from 4 to 2 since we are talking about a port here.  The story is still all there and that was one of the reasons we all loved these games.  However, I am running into bugs, some minor (glitched mobs, vanishing vehicles, lag during bigger fights) and some major (odd insta-death in recently cleared rooms and a couple full crashes).  My hope is that we see a patch in the future that will cure these.For a fan of the Vita and Borderlands this is definitely worth grabbing.  For new players the story (with some acceptance of gameplay issues) makes this a worthwhile purchase.  If you're not a big Vita fan or are pretty hardcore about the look and features of the original releases stick with the PC/console versions for now and wait for a price drop or sale.\"]\n",

If you want to read a review of it there are many good ones under PS3 or X360 version.Let\\'s keep the review short:The good: a full game, comes with all DLC so far, and it\\'s enjoyable as always. Co-op is here, even though it is reduced to 2-men. Cross save is a nice touch, I can just use my max level characters from PS3.The bad: The graphic quality is just OK. I\\'m not expecting console quality but even for a handheld game it is very muddy and the texture resolutions are reduced drastically to accommodate the VITA\\'s ability. Some changes are very noticeable such as enemies just vanish into a blood stain when they die. Sound quality also suffers. Music, voice over and sound effects are noticeably low bit-rate.These issues I can tolerate, however frame rate issue is a DEAL BREAKER. I played the beginning part of the game to Sanctuary, which is roughtly 40 minutes of play time. The majority of time the FPS is below 30, probably around 20 per my guessing. Low FPS in first person shooter makes me feel dizzy. Also it even lags at times, for instance you shoot a bullet to an enemy 10 meters away, roughly 0.5 second later you see a \"critical hit\" pops up. This should happen as soon as you pull the trigger. Hiccups are here and there: when you pass a save point, when multiple enemies in the screen, even when you bring out your character menu, you notice a small slow down.I was really looking forward to enjoy my handheld borderlands experience, but the technical issues, specifically the frame rate issue, made me regret making the purchase.

How in Heaven's sweet name did they manage it? Tons, I mean TONS, of content. Great, addicting leveling system. XP gains lead to rewards every 5-10 minutes.

            " ['I waited before posting my review since I wanted to test the cross-save functionality and 2-player co-op features of the game.There have been many reviews on this game and just about every single game critic review that I have seen have lambasted the Vita version for not living up to the PS3 version.  Is it fair?  No...but it\\'s an issue that\\'s hard to avoid.  With some of the gameplay issues, one may wonder if it\\'s worth the purchase or not if one already owns it...and I\\'ll get into that later.This review assumes that the reader is familiar with the first Borderlands.  Borderlands 2 is a continuation of the first game, with new Vault Hunters arriving to Pandora at the behest of Hyperion Corporation\\'s recent leader, Handsome Jack.  Handsome Jack betrays the players straight off the bat (he has no interest in having others \"help\"...he just wants to entice Vault Hunters to kill them off) and leaves them for dead.  The would-be Vault Hunters are discovered by the lovable ready-to-quip robot, Claptrap, and the adventure thus begins and eventually involves Vault Hunters from the original game.  It\\'s addictively good fun to say the least and the shoot-and-loot that made the first game so fun to play returns in spades here.Value-------First and foremost, this issue of Borderlands 2 includes 6 DLC\\'s, so at $39.99 it\\'s a fantastic purchase at launch.  Without factoring in the PS3\\'s season pass, you\\'re looking at about $50 of DLC alone.Gameplay--------------I was worried when critics shredded the game because of the lack of L2/R2/L3/R3 functionality.  Instead, the rear touch pad is utilized.  I use trigger grips, so I didn\\'t find myself \"accidentally\" touching the pad as some critics have claimed.  Tap the left side of the rear touch pad and you engage in sprinting (no need to hold it down...you\\'ll run and keep running unless you stop or get interrupted).  Tap the right side and you\\'ll use your melee attack.  Touch the lower right-side of the touchscreen and you\\'ll activate your special ability.  Touch the lower left-side of the touchscreen and you\\'ll throw a grenade.Don\\'t like where the controls are mapped?  Well, guess what...you can remap them!  Including that in the programming of the game was a big plus for me.There are a few unfortunate cons, however:1.  Two-player co-op.  The inclusion of a 4-player co-op session proved to be too much for the hardware, so that sacrifice was made.  Considering that only my daughter and I play, that wasn\\'t a huge one for us.2.  Lower enemy counts.  The hardware, again, is pushed to its limits so you\\'ll find densely populated areas (like the Varkids in Caustic Caverns) to be reduced by about 20 - 30% compared to its console/PC brother.3.  No ad-hoc mode.  Really?  Why would you NOT include an ad-hoc mode in addition to finding other players online, especially given that ad-hoc generally runs much smoother than a Wi-Fi session?  This is an unfortunate omission, especially given that my daughter and I play it...we\\'re forced to go online.Yes, I know that I\\'m comparing the hardware again, but if being forced to choose between alternatives, then one should know.  However, there are reasons to get it which I\\'ll describe later in \"Who Should Get This.\"Graphics------------This is where the unfortunate comparisons are made again.Graphics take a noticeable hit...far off plateaus may pop in \"closer\" than the console/PC versions.  If the firefight gets heavy, framerates will drop noticeably below the 30 fps target.  Enemies will explode in red, rapidly disappearing chunks instead of ragdolling to the ground.Is it game-breaking?  No...it\\'s just occasionally...\"jarring.\"  But I didn\\'t find myself in a framerate drop so massive that I found myself dead in the next heartbeat...once you get used to it, it plays just fine, especially with a 2nd player.That said, I\\'ve heard many people stating that the Vita\\'s hardware can\\'t be expected to do much, etc., etc.  Given how good certain titles look (especially Uncharted Golden Abyss O-M-G), I find that explanation to be a frustratingly bad one.  Borderlands 2 isn\\'t a graphical marvel by any means and I know that the Vita could have handled more.  That, and given that the Vita\\'s resolution is lower than the PS3, it makes me wonder how much of the hardware is truly at fault especially given how impressive other titles look.  Part of it may have to do with how well the original title was coded to begin with and relying on the brute force of console/PC power to compensate for sloppier coding...we\\'ll never know.  But, like I said, Uncharted titles on both the PS3/Vita platforms demonstrate that the hardware is capable of so much more.In summary, graphically it looks quite decent but there are some minor framerate/texture/pop-in caveats that go along with that.  Other than that, it looks like a miniature version of the big brother versions.Who Should Get This-----------------------------The million-dollar question.  If you already on it on the PS3 and/or the PC, and you prefer to play with 2-3 others, pass on this.  If you only play with one other or by yourself and you have it on the PS3, then you may want to get it if you play on the road because of the cross-save feature.In my case, however, I play exclusively with my daughter... which comes to my next point.  The really NICE thing about Borderlands 2 on the Vita is that your saves will transfer from the PS3 and vice versa.  Simply upload your saved character and download on the other platform and you\\'re good to go.  My daughter and I both own Vitas with our own accounts and this worked PERFECTLY for us.  We usually play on the PS3 at home, but recently we played on our Vitas during vacation with our characters on the road.  Some items, unfortunately, do NOT transfer because only 2 of the 4 MAIN DLC expansions (not including the headhunters) are not available on the Vita...yet (and that is a hopeful \"yet\").  But never feat!  Your items are still there...but DLC-specific items, skins, etc., from DLCs not available yet on the Vita won\\'t show up in the Vita.As a result, I love my Vita copy simply because we can take our adventure on the road.  I\\'m hoping eventually that the other DLC\\'s become available (especially Tiny Tina\\'s Assault on Dragon\\'s Keep...the funniest and best DLC ever).Summary-------------Borderlands 2 on the Vita is not a perfect experience nor is it as complete as the console/PC versions, but the shoe may fit for you if you play it by yourself or just one other.  Some lacking features are unfortunate, but the DLC\\'s that are available at launch (and the $39.99 price tag to boot) offset these immeasurably and still make it fun to play.  I haven\\'t encountered any groundbreaking issues with our Level 50 characters and we are looking forwards to many additional hours of fun.']\n",

There is a slight jolt or lag in the game from time to time and the loading times when entering a new level sometimes are a little long, the over-all gameplay experience is still very good and reminds me of the amazing gameplay on the PS3. I love the fact that all of my old DLC's for this game are included and I can play them all over again. If you still have a PS3 and have this game loaded with the save files and characters, you can sync them and play them on the PS Vita.

The challenging part is completing the various requests (mini-games) to earn seeds to plant new produce.  There are over fifty varieties of fruits, vegetables, and flowers to grow.At the start of each day Mama will wake up to find a forest friend making a request for their shop and a letter in the mail box looking for help in completing a task that pays in seeds or spending money.

As you successfully grow things your garden will level up and expand allowing you to grow more plants and decorate it further.']\n",
            " [\"I'm fairly mixed as far as my opinion about this game goes. If this is your first foray into the Mama game franchise, it's not an awful place to start but the problem is that the franchise has done this before and done far better than GM2:FF.On the plus side, there are a lot of things here that players will absolutely adore. You can customize your garden to suit your personal tastes, as there are a multitude of different things you can use to get it to that specific look. This will undoubtedly please people who dislike having a typical cookie cutter display. The other good thing is that there are a wide variety of plants to grow, all of which fit into three basic types of plants: flowers, veggies, and fruit. The little mini-games are also fun and while they're fairly limited, they mostly fit in with what people have come to expect from the Mama franchise.Unfortunately there are a few things that detract from the title as a whole. The first issue is that the game is a little limited in what it offers people. The 3D aspect of this doesn't really offer much in the way of a bonus. It's not that users will really expect awesome 3D graphics from a Mama game, but this feels like it could have been released on the regular DS years ago and without losing terribly much. It also doesn't help that at times the game controls feel a little off, especially when you get that one specific mini-game that is incredibly difficult to complete at 100%. Since most of the games are almost insanely easy, this isn't really a big issue. However there's the other problem: whereas in previous games you would have millions of little mini-games that come up, this is actually fairly limited in what it has to offer. It's fun, but at the same time I couldn't help but feel that this would have been better if it'd started at the twenty dollar price point. The full thirty dollar price is a bit much, considering what you get from this in comparison to other Mama games.I guess in the end the most frustrating aspect of this was that it really, really came across like it was targeted to very young players. It's fun and people of all ages can and likely will enjoy it, but this is the first game in the Mama series that really came across as a child's game. I definitely recommend it to fans of the series since what they do have is pretty darn fun and can be addicting, but many of you will probably be happier if you wait for a previously used copy to hit the shelves.\"]\n",

            " [\"I understand that sequels do not have to be just like their original games, but Gardening Mama 2 has removed a significant amount of the gardening gameplay that made Gardening Mama so great. Specifically, there are no more mini-games associated with growing and taking care of the flowers and fruits/veg. Now, you just pick a space in your garden with your stylus, select plant, and the seed is automatically planted. When the next day cycles over, you just tap the space again and select water, and just hold down to water the plant. Apart from random events when the plant sometimes withers and you need to spray away viruses or swat away flies, this is almost the entirety of the gardening. Many times it feels like a cross between a flash Harvest Moon game and a spruced up Farmville. This is made even worse since there are so many more breeds of flowers and fruits/vegetables to grow in the game (compared to the first one) but this has become moot since every single thing takes the same simple tap of the stylus to grow and nothing else. Not only that, but everything you &#34;grow&#34; is now an automatic gold medal (I haven't once gotten a silver or bronze, but I believe the only way to get them is if you forget to water the plant?).The main point of the game now, as the subtitle suggests, is to help out various forest creatures with their businesses by providing them with flowers, fruits, vegetables, and wood that you harvest from your garden. This feature is actually a pretty nice addition that WOULD have made the game so much better IF it actually took anything to grow those flowers and fruits; but it doesn't. Helping these creatures out rewards you with shopping & lottery tickets, which you use to buy decorations for your garden.There are indeed several real mini-games that you need to complete in order to unlock all of the flowers and fruits/veg and they are very fun (the main game only lets you do one per day but they are available anytime in the Help Out section of the main menu); they are treated as separate 'chore' mini-games though and once you go through all of them once (to unlock all seeds) there becomes no incentive to play them again other than to get a gold medal on them.I would recommend this for a small child, preferably who also hasn't played the first game. If you enjoyed the first Gardening Mama and are looking forward to a similar game for the 3DS, don't get this; or maybe wait until it's &#60;$15.\"]\n",

I used a non-gaming one for a long time until getting a R.A.T. 5, which I've seen sensor issues with lately.First impressions are all amazing with the G502.  The sensor is great, and works wonderfully on a variety of surfaces (desk, mouse pad, etc).  There is no acceleration, so your hand movements are very accurately transferred to the computer.  The software it uses is intuitive and easy to use, and the preset mouse controls are great (I only played around a little with custom settings).For build quality I prefer aluminum, this is all plastic.  That said its more than strong enough to deal with any tension grippingIn terms of comfort: I have large hands, and I found the mouse comfortable - the thumb rest comfortable was a great inclusion.  My wife, who has small hands, also found it comfortable - I imagine that we encompass the gamut of most people's hand sizes.My one complaint with the mouse is that there is no way to customize the scroll wheel.  You get a button to alternate between smooth scrolling and clicky scrolling, and thats it.  For an 80 dollar plus mouse thats a pretty glaring oversight.If you require a customizable scroll wheel you will need to look elsewhere.  Otherwise I think the mouse is a great buy for the money - the sensor quality and comfort level are right where they need to be, and those are really the most important aspects of a mouse.\"]\n",

More detail on the Proteus:[---Quality---]With Logitech you can either get a good quality mouse or not--price does not have a place on which you will find. The proteus feels very solid and well built. The fact that you can add weights allows it to be more heavy that is directed by what you prefer.The buttons are fairly loud and have a generous 'clicking' depth--how far you depress your finger to click. For very fast gamers who need precision, this may be a bad thing for you. It is not 'too' deep however it is different than many mice I have tried.You can adjust the scroll wheel to either spin freely or 'click' spin. This is useful if you have it bound to weapon select, for example, or simply like the silent 'spin free' option.[---Use---]Works on any surface that I tried without a mousepad. Sensitivity could be adjusted and at the highest settings it was extremely so. Very precise movement.There are many programmable buttons however, like most mice, they actually less--realistically--than advertised. There are over 20 that are not going to be used by other functions that you can program. They are placed mainly by the right thumb. Some are more jagged buttons and others small. Good button mapping and they are fairly easy to hit when your in the midst of a game.---------------------------------------------While some 'premium' releases by Logitech were underwhelming, the Proteus is one that fits exactly what it is intended for--gaming. It is comfortable in the hand, adjustable, and programmable. Since the quality warrants the price, this is one of the best overall gaming mice.\"]\n",

            " [\"Bought this at my local best buy today! It's kind of funny because I saw this announced 1 or 2 days ago and randomly looked this up to see if Bestbuy.com had this and here it is!! So I've been a user of logitech gaming mice since the red G510mx gaming mouse (still my favorite ever) and I've dabbled a little with razor mice, which I don't like using as much. I used to use the G602 and Ouroboros (I'll be comparing to this one a lot)  but now I'm switching to this. Here are my impressions of the Logitech G502 mouse:So this mouse looks like Logitech's answer to the Razer Ouroboros mouse, but it's actually a redesign of the G500s mouse, or something the G500s mouse should've been all along ever since they rebranded the G500 with there whole gaming brand push with the G-Series. I never loved the G500s mouse because the third button under the forward and back mouse buttons felt too close to me. The design and layout on this mouse is fantastic.The design of this mouse looks very similar to the Ourorboros (and G602) mouse because the side of it looks sleek and almost like a batmobile but this one is way more comfortable to use. With the Ouroboros it always felt like I had to adjust my hands to get used to it since it was ambidextrous, but this feels like it was designed for my right hand. The dpi switch button on the side feels perfect compared unlike the Ouroboros where you had to push and hold down the whole left side of the mouse which felt really awkward because of the extreme pressure you had to put on it which could throw off your aim. Without the weights on it's super light and one neat thing about it is that you can actually calibrate this mouse to use it for any mousepad. It's not a gimmick and after calibrating this on my Razer Destructor mousepad it feels much more precise.I can tell that they listen to their consumers because I remember one person complaining on the logitech forums how the g602 got rid of the side left and side right click middle mouse button and now it's back. While I do like the design of the G602 (a lot) seeing all the buttons bunched up like that confused me when I was playing a game where I wasn't using it for 1-6 keys. In diablo 3, I can now use the dpi button for potion and maybe i could configure the left and right middle button click to inventory and skill commands and it would feel a lot more natural to me. The also brought back the endless scrolling on the wheel if you wanted but I never really cared for that. I also use the dpi button for search charm command which feels really awesome. Yes you can do this with any recent logitech mouse, but this button placement feels so nice :)But other than that, there's nothing that feels super unique about this mouse, it's basically a really well designed and successor to G500s and I know a lot of gamers had major issues with the design and usability of that mouse. Other than not being wireless I will say that this absolutely destroys the ouroboros mouse because I paid 150 dollars for that, yikes. After using that for a month I realized that they put more work into deciding to sell and showcase it in a fancy glass cube rather than making a super comfy mouse with good controls and no weird freezes and profile switching like razer synapse software. A good gaming mouse should feel natural and like an extension of your hand and this is why I'm satisfied with my purchase. This probably isn't the best mouse in the world and I am aware that they borrowed some design elements (like the dpi button placement) from other gaming hardware competitors but I've been a long time logitech peripheral buyer for some time now and I think it's great to see that they make mostly (don't get me started on their gaming headsets) good products :)\"]\n",

            " [\"I use a palm grip. For the money, I much prefer theLogitech G602 Wireless Gaming Mouse with 250 Hour Battery Lifeand I'll explain why in this review.This wired mouse, the G502, weighs about 4.8oz without any weights inside.  By flipping down the blue plastic piece at the thumbrest you can add additional weights, 36 grams at a time, to bring the mouse to 6 ounces.  If you are someone who needs to have a mouse at a specific weight, then I can understand why this mouse appeals to you.  The cord is braided for extra protection, and the length of the cord stretches to six feet.  That's nice too.My first problem is with the scroll wheel.  Behind the scroll wheel is a button that sticks up.  You can click that down to lock the wheel so it clicks.  The clicks require more force than other Logitech mice, enough that each click rattles the body of the mouse a little bit.  Compared to other, better, mice it's difficult to move the mouse forward without pressing down hard.  I like the slight click in gaming mice like the G602 and G700s but this G502 has a terrible click wheel.Secondly, the button placement is atrocious.  Even with the button behind the scroll wheel pressed down, it still sticks up so much that there is just no way of getting to the button behind it without moving your finger back to press it.  In addition, the buttons next to the left mouse button are really awkwardly placed.  I think there are supposed to be three buttons on the left side of the left mouse button but the one farthest back (behind the G7 button) is so difficult to press that I can't see an easy way to press down on it.  Maybe if you move your thumb to the top of the mouse?  How awkward is that?  The other two buttons are in this weird triangle shape that sticks out.  If you try to press down on them with your left mouse finger, you'll press the mouse button down as well.  Especially the second button.  Look at the zoomed-in images and see what I mean.The thumb mouse buttons are just as confusing.  The button directly in front of your thumb is easy to press, assuming your hands are big enough.  However the two buttons above the thumb are way above your thumb.  Good luck finding them if you need to act fast.Who designed this mouse?  I generally love Logitech products but this thing was designed by Salvador Dali.  If you are an alien, or grew mutated hands from falling into a vat of radioactive waste then this mouse might work for you.  I can't imagine why anyone would want this unless they absolutely must have their mouse at a certain weight.  Everyone else, get the G602 instead.\"]\n",
            " [\"This is a second Logitech mouse for me and I am really starting to like their mice.Right off the top of my head my favorite feature of this mouse and the other that I own is the button that switches between the two settings for the scroll wheel.  The first setting is the same that you get on pretty much every mouse.  As you scroll it you feel it click into place over and over again to give a smooth stop to the web page or document. This can be fatiguing and a hassle when you have a large amount of scrolling to do or want to get somewhere with any speed.  The second setting has no barrier for movement and spins just about as fast as you could want it to go. So when you just want to get to the bottom of something you click the button, spin it and it won't take long.  The drawback is while this setting is engaged you can have the page scroll a bit up or down in normal usage, but usually only when the wheel stops close to a point where it tells the screen to scroll.  In any event, you don't really leave it in this setting anyways, its for fast movement, and I have grown to love it and want it on every mouse.As far as other features, it has plenty of buttons and I have used this mouse to put all my Diablo 3 skills right on it.You have your back and forward thumb buttons, two index finger buttons to the left of the left click, the scroll click down, scroll click left, scroll click right, a mechanical button for scroll mode switching, a refresh button and a dpi button.Most every button can be used for anything you desire, you merely have to set it with the software.You can even have profiles for each game that will load to the mouse when the game does.The only drawbacks I can find to the mouse as a whole is that it is permanently wired, but that truly inst that big of a deal.

I found that this Logitech mouse is comfortable to use, even for hours on end. Mouse tracking is very accurate and you can even tune it to the type of surface you use it on using the Logitech software.Having some unpleasant past experience with cordless mouses where the battery died on me in the middle of a gaming session, I\\'m glad this gaming mouse is wired. The wire doesn\\'t look cheaply made and seems tangle free. The wire didn\\'t distract me at all in the few gaming sessions. However, the wire still presents some clutter on the desk.This mouse doesn\\'t seem to exhibit any acceleration. Hand movement translates to movement on the screen accurately as intended. Also, there is no lag at all since it\\'s wired.Some of the highlights are:* Zero acceleration for precise gaming* High sensitivity sensor with selectable levels of DPI* Mouse buttons don\\'t feel cheap and provide good feedback* Mouse is highly configurable using downloadable software from Logitech* High quality shell and construction* Adjustable mouse weight using included weights* Metal scroll wheel switchable between clicking and free rotating modes with the touch of a button on topThe only problem I have with the mouse is the glowing \"G\" logo on it. It is rather bright, especially in a darkened room at night. Though there is a way to turn it off with the Logitech software. I wish there is a way to dim it also.Overall, the G502 is a great wired mouse. Zero acceleration. Accurate movement and precise buttons. Highly customizable. It\\'s also comfortable to use. It\\'s great for gaming as well as for everyday use.']\n",
            " [\"I have been using this mouse on my production machine for 7-8 hours a day for a while now, and I like the form factor, smooth glide and responsive buttons.  If you use the Logitech software, it is almost absurdly configurable.  I also liked the LMB and RMB click feel which was very positive and not mushy.  The click wheel also has the same firm click feel.  You can easily switch to click-free scrolling with a press of button on the top.  I tried it for a while, it was nearly friction free (but not my cup of tea- I like the clicks).Set-up was easy.  The box and set-up instructions are clear and straight forward.  You need to download the software from the Logitech site, but if you have been using high end gaming mouses for a while you are probably used to that.  However, Windows 7 recognize the mouse without the software if you want to forgo the download (and lose the customization).One neat touch is the braided mouse cable, which doesn't seem to get hung up on stuff as much as the cables on cheaper mouses.  Another is the well formed right thumb groove, which felt great in use.  Overall, this is a fantastic corded gaming mouse with a ton of adjustments (weight, button configurations, DPI ect) that works well for right handed claw grips.  Recommended.\"]\n",

            " [\"This mouse, the G502 Proteus Core is an upgrade from my previous mouse which was the Logitech G2 Laser Mouse (a worthy mouse for excellent gaming).The G502 takes my gaming mouse to the next level with more programmable keys/buttons, free spinning wheel, and higher levels of DPI.Getting the mouse of the of box was the most difficult part of setup - and it was VERY difficult. Talk about frustration-full packaging - the amount of plastic and sleeve in this was just ridiculous. But eventually I was able to remove the corded mouse, the box of weights, and the additional taped-on weight. I plugged in the mouse to a rear USB port on the computer and within moments it was active and brightly lit up (the G image on the front lights up but you can turn it off if you don't like it).I did install the supplemental software, which I generally don't do, but it offers complete customisation and profile creation for the mouse. I'm referring to the Logitech Gaming Software. This tool allows you to configure pretty much EVERYTHING about this mouse, starting with DPI sensitivity levels and polling rates, to profile creation (up to 3), to button/key assignment and configuration (this was particularly interesting to me so that I could assign the control key to a button on the side which made playing Tom Clancy Splinter Cell Blacklist easier.The software also allows you to perform surface tuning, so let the mouse know what kind of pad you have which has a huge impact on the sensor. Setting this correctly to my Amazon Basics mouse pad made a big difference in-game. You can also create custom surfaces if you want.Other settings include the illumination of the G logo on the front - which I didn't really mess with because the light doesn't bother me. Some games can manipulate the illumination as well if you allow for it.On the top you've got a profile selector button and the lock button for the free spinning wheel. Push the lock and it behaves like every normal mouse out there, push it again and the wheel becomes free spinning. Love this for scrolling through long web pages. On the left side you've got buttons to very quickly change the DPI, or use as hot keys that you've programmed.The textured grip on the left and right side is tasteful and doesn't feel chunky.In a small black container you have additional weights you can add to the underside of the mouse - it's really easy to pop off the bottom, add or remove weights based on your personal needs. It comes with 5 additional 3.6g weights. Also taped inside the box is a small silver weight which has no markings on it, but was taped to the plastic. It's not a battery, and there's no tag on it to identify what it might be.The mouse performs admirably in basic windows functions, as well as all my games like Skyrim, Blacklist, Borderlands, and more.A worthy upgrade from the laser mouse, and a solid 4 stars for this product.\"]\n",
            " ['This review is more targeted towards people coming from the popular Logitech MX518/G400, and Razer Deather Adder. so far i\\'ve clocked about 20+ hours on this mice over the weekend.throughout the years, i\\'ve gone through my fair share of gaming mouse. but i always find myself keep going back to the classic logitech design of MX518/G7/G400/G400s. to me the classic design of these MICE is the most ergonomic to me with the exception that i have big hands. i\\'ve always wished logitech could come out with slightly larger version of their classic design, but they never did. Rzer Ouroboros sort of \"tried\" but failed (see my other detailed review on it). let me just get this out there first. the G502 is NOT bigger than the classic logitech that many come to love. it\\'s almost identical in size, but slightly narrower in width.Pros:1. additional buttons. more buttons than MX518/G400. which is one of the main reason i wanted to give this mouse a try.2. the mechanical buttons are also very well constructed, which requires LESS effort to click than the classic MX518/G400 (good or bad that\\'s up to you).3. two mode scroll wheel (i don\\'t really care for, but none the less a pro in comparison to the classic)4. onboard profiler memory, which stores up to 3 button configurations, with a dedicated profiler button to switch between profiles. (hardly care for it either, i only use one profile, none the less a pro in comparison to classic).5. Braided cable, an upgrade from the classic.6. DPI gear that\\'s next to your index finger, which requires less effort to switch DPI than the classic MX518/G400 placement. the DPI level LED indicator is also an added benefit.7. Weight Adjustment (which i don\\'t care for, none the less an added bonus).Cons:1. the eliminated of \"the lip\", next to the right button. this is my personal NO 1 gripe. i truely enjoyed the \"lip\" in the old classic design next to the right click button. the \"lip\" is the space to the right of the old classic design right click botton, which allows your ring finger to rest on it. the G502 \"almost\" completely gets rid of the lip, leaving just a slight chasis edge space. my ring finger now rests on that edge of the body. it\\'s not as comfortable as the old classic design for me, but so far it hasn\\'t bother me to a point that makes me want to return the unit. i will update more as time goes. the Razer Deathe Adder would otherwise be a perfect mouse if it had some kind of lip to rest your ring finger, but instead the right click button is completely covering the right half of the mouse, as a result death adder causes my ring finger to overstretch overtime and causes wrist pain.2. my NO 2 gripe is that the added thumb button is hard to reconfigure. the additional thumb button defaults to DIP shift. i wanted this additional button for purposes of additional button to assign to FPS weapon config menu, or additional FPS specialty option. anything but DPI shift. the way the 3rd thumb button is setup, it\\'s not setup as a generic mouse button like every other button on my MICE that you can easily re-assign in games. you CANNOT leave it as DPI shift, or give it unassigned. in both cases, games don\\'t recognize this third button. the only way for games to recognize this 3rd button is for you to assign this button as a keyboard key. in the end i assigned a keyboard \"\\\\\" key to this button for games to recognize it, and for me to re-assign it.3. logitech gaming software is crap. when it works it works. you can assign commands to whatever button on the mice, ie. the 3rd thumb button. BUT WHEN IT WORKS. of the 15 games i have installed on my machine (all popular AAA titles), only 3 were recognized. as a result, i can\\'t assigned commands to the 3rd thumb button. and games won\\'t recognize the 3rd thumb button by default. most of the time the software itself has trouble picking up steam games. guess what, these days most people use steam. sometimes when the software does recognize the game, and you\\'re able to assign custom commands to each button, \"some\" games custom profile don\\'t properly load up. for example, BF4 would load up custom profile fine, but Diable 3 won\\'t, which requires you to Alt-Tab of the game, and open logitech software and close it back and ALt-Tab back into the game.4. the scroll wheel is a bit loose. logitech added a \"left\" \"right\" feature to the scroll wheel. i am not sure if as a result, the wheel seems to have a bit of \"wiggle\" room. if you shake the mouse real hard and fast you can feel the scroll wheel banging against both sides and shaking. not something i would like to see in a $79 mouse.5. slightly narrower in width compare to the classic design, mainly due to the lack of lip.6. the weight of the mouse is already heavy without any added weights. one of the best thing about the classic design of MX518/G400 was that it\\'s light weight. i wish they could make this mouse as light as the classic to start with, before you start adding weights.all the above mentioned points are what stands out to those coming from MX518/G400/G7/DA/Mamba. i also feel the \"forward\" thumb button is a bit too far back towards your palm, in comparison to the classic design. as a result, many times i mean to hit \"back\" thumb button, and accidentally triggers \"forward\" thumb button. it\\'s not exactly a con, hence it\\'s not on the list. i\\'d imagine it only takes time to get use to this.this mouse is NOT a solution for people like me with big hands, it\\'s not bigger than the classic design of MX518/G400, or Razer DA. it does not have adjustable length nor height. what it does bring extra to your table is the added 3rd thumb button, the same precision and feel of the G400 optical sensor (but more DPI, which i don\\'t care for beyond 2400), two mode scroll wheel with added \"left/right\" feature, onboard profiling and switching, good DPI gear button placement, and lastly cool LED lighting effect. in the end if you already have a G400, or G400S, is it worth upgrading? probably not. Bottom line, you\\'re only getting one extra thumb button and a cool lighting effects. but i just wanted to try something new. if your G400 or MX518, G7 is already dead, and you\\'re looking for a replacement, and if the lack of Lip space doesn\\'t bother you, i\\'d give the G502 a try.4 out of 5 star, if Logitech could implement some kind of lip to the right click button for you to rest your ring finger like you would with MX518/G400/G7 and many other similar models, and adds the ability to extend the length of the mouse, or even raise the height, they\\'ll have a winner. i will update the review as i go.']\n",
            " ['I&#8217;ve used many mice over the years. The old corded, early wireless, Bluetooth, laser.  And more recently I have been using corded gaming mice for a couple of years.I often have two mice for gaming since some sim style games that use joystick for control work best if you can look around using the mouse so having one on the left side of the desk is useful.So till now I have had the Genius Marius X Gaming mouse (ambidextrous design) on the left. And the older trusty G500 gaming mouse for general use on the right.I have just replaced the G500 with this new G502 Proteus Core gaming mouse.One thing I appreciated from the start was the packaging. The 502 is a corded mouse that has a braided cable much like the 500. To this day my old G500 still has the original kinks visible from where the cable was folded in the packaging. So I did notice when I opened up the box to see that the G502 braided cable is stowed in a large loop around the mouse so there is no kinking and you do not have a zig zag of cable strewn over the desk.The  G502 has DPI buttons sensitivity toggle buttons, three thumb buttons, ratchet or smooth scroll wheel that also does side to side scrolling. It&#8217;s more of a claw grip than a cup one and the base of the mouse flares out with a lip that supports your thumb above the desk surface so the mouse moves more smoothly.This flared piece is also the edge of a plastic lid under the mouse that when unhinged reveals a place to add weights to the mouse and make it more hefty. I like a weighted mouse, it offers me a little more resistance that enables you to modulate the pressure you use for small precise movements. Very useful when you use this mouse for graphics applications as well as games.One interesting thing is that this lid is held in place by a magnet. So there is no clasp that will eventually break. The magnet is cylindrical and slots into a hole in the mouse holding it firmly closed.I have a Logitech G series cloth gaming mat, and the sensor on this mouse is supposed to be tuneable from the profiler software. Since it is part of the same series it has a built in preset which worked very well. It seems noticeably more precise than the old G500, it glides more smoothly too (which I didn&#8217;t expect from a brand new mouse).The sides that you grip with your thumb and pinkie have a knurled rubberized surface that grips well and the whole mouse feels snug in my hands.The only thing I preferred on the old G500 was the scroll wheel which had rubberized strip in the center with very fine knurling where this new one has a chunky ribbed surface that is quite smooth and doesn&#8217;t grip quite as well though the ribs feel like they do synch with the scroll wheel ratchet mechanism if you have that enabled.Overall I really like this mouse. It came at a good time when my old G500 was starting to feel the wear. After thousands of hours of use two main buttons were getting worn posts and not holding a click as reliably. The new G502 feels like it has better button mechanisms, with a more precise feel and sound that is also apparent in the extra buttons around the mouse. The old G500 model felt like it had lower quality secondary buttons that felt a little spongy and imprecise.One neat thing if you play games: By default one of the thumb buttons acts as a DPI shift button, so you can hold it down to change the sensitivity of the mouse on the fly. This is useful if you want to temporarily have more precision for say sniping in a game. Or for making very small pixel movements in a graphics app like photoshop.The mouse looks better than in the photos where the strong lighting makes it look very edgy and suggests it might not be as comfortable as the previous smooth teardrop type design. It looks better in person though blue LED illuminated G on top is a little disconcerting and very bright.There are some simple controls for the illuminated G in the profiler software always on or off, or turn off after x number of minutes.The profiler software has extensive control of the mouse and its sensitivity. You can create your own presets. The default settings barely touch the full range of sensitivity of the mouse which by default has 4 presets between 1200 and 6400 DPI (it actually goes up to 12000 DPI). You can also set your USB polling rate for the mouse so updates can be sent from 125 to 1000 times a second.Naturally you can use the profiler to set up custom macros for your games and apps. It&#8217;s quite extensive and allows you to save three primary configurations on the mouse itself without having to start the software to load new configurations.So a noticeable improvement over the G500. It seems like a well thought out design with some innovative new features that suit graphics artists and gamers well. It&#8217;s obvious some thought went into this mouse from the packaging up and I do appreciate having a non kinked mouse cord straight out of the box. A small thing sure, but one you notice straight away when it doesn&#8217;t get caught on edges of things  or look ugly.']\n",

            " ['For years I have been using the MX 518. It\\'s a fantastic mouse, but there have been many upgrades and additions to mouse technology since then. I\\'ve been drooling over other mice, namely from Razer, Zowie, and Logitech; Logitech has the best general mice, though they may not have as many fancy features as others. Still, if you want a sturdy mouse that will last you years, Logitech is the way to go.The G502 combines the best of all mouse worlds for me. It\\'s got a braided cord, combines my favorite colors in their scheme, has a two-way scroll wheel WITH BUTTON, different DPI buttons, forward and backward buttons, and an additional side button. It also has two buttons behind the scroll wheel, but one is dedicated to the wheel mode setting. There\\'s also a longer groove on the side for the thumb to rest, and it\\'s more comfortable than the one on my MX 518. The wheel tilts to allow side scrolling, but it never works for me the way I want it no matter how I change the settings.I had an Anywhere MX mouse and I HATED the wheel. I much preferred the MX 518 scrolling, and still kind of do. The Proteus uses the same wheel type as the Anywhere, but the clicking isn\\'t as forceful; it\\'s still harder than the MX 518, but I\\'ve actually gotten quite used to it now.The left mouse button is shorter and higher than the right one, and that\\'s perfect for me as I have a semi-claw grip. The \"G\" icon does indeed have a bright light, but it\\'s never bothered me. Either way, you can change the setting to how long it stays on while idle or to shut off permanently.I\\'ll get to the weights in a bit.But the best feature? For me at least it\\'s the reprogrammable buttons.I\\'ve reprogramed the wheel button and the one behind, as well as the additional button in front of the forward button. The forward and backward buttons I\\'ve kept the same, and I\\'m glad to report that they\\'re much better stationed than the one on my MX 518. The MX forward button caused me to slide my hand to reach it, whereas I can easily reach both on the Proteus without removing my hand from the mouse.The lip is very comfortable for my thumb, and provides more of a rest than my previous \"gaming\" mouse.Now for the weights.They come with the mouse in this neat little case. The bottom of the mouse opens extremely easily, but it\\'s sturdy enough so that it won\\'t come undone on its own. There\\'s no tactile or audible click or anything, but you\\'ll tell when the bottom is securely back on. I\\'ve used only one weight so far and I\\'m pretty satisfied with that. I tested it over a week with different weights before deciding on my own preference.Most of the mouse is made of plastic as you\\'d expect, while the sides have this nice rubber texture for better grip. It\\'s not the sort of rubber that will show dead skin easily, so no worries there. This is my first mouse with a braided cable, and I\\'m quite pleased with its lightweight maneuverability thus far.Overall I\\'m very pleased. It\\'s everything I wanted in a mouse, and a worthy upgrade to my MX 518. I keep the latter at work now.I\\'m not a gaming expert; I just wanted a comfortable mouse that\\'ll be perfect for all my normal tasks, and will prove competent for my Steam gaming.There are some pretty good wireless mouses out there, but I always tend to stick with corded when possible to decrease computer error. Same applies for my video games The Proteus couldn\\'t have come at a better time, as I\\'ve only recently started to consider upgrading my mouse. I\\'m glad I waited, despite how new this is.

            " ['Based on having played in about half of the beta, this is a game which does not start particularly strong, but gets better about 10-20 levels in.  I say this as a warning to players, because the starting experience for many will be less than exhilarating.  I believe it is done this way so as to introduce the typical MMO player more gently into the telegraph system of combat which is the core of the game, and which is not common in MMORPGs (The Secret World had it, but for the most part it isn&#8217;t common in the genre).That system features enemies which do two kinds of damage to you.  The first is their autoattack damage (so-called &#8220;white damage&#8221;).  This damage cannot be avoided, even by actively dodging the attack &#8211; it will always hit you.  This is designed to make tanking and healing relevant for more difficult fights.  The second type is special damage that comes from larger attacks which are telegraphed &#8211; that is, outlines of various shapes will be drawn on the ground (and morph as they are being drawn in some cases) to indicate where the damage will be dealt.  The damage from these attacks can be avoided completely by moving out of the telegraph or dodging out of it in a timely fashion.  If you do not do so, beginning in the teen levels, you will lose a great deal of health, and in some cases, die in one hit.  So the focus of the combat is constantly being on the move to avoid increasingly intricate telegraphs (they start off very simple in lower levels and them ramp up to be quite intricate, complex and varied, requiring faster reflexes and responses as the player becomes more comfortable with the system.  As a result, the combat style is very active, with the player having to move the character around constantly to avoid telegraphs, while at the same time actively aiming their own attacks at the enemies, who are, of course, also moving.  The game requires a certain degree of &#8220;twitch skill&#8221; , therefore, in order to play effectively and, more importantly, in order to be fully enjoyed the player should really prefer twitch skill gaming to the more traditional style of MMO combat.That combat system is the most unique aspect of WildStar.  The rest of it is more familiar, but done in a relatively polished and complete way.  There are the standard kinds of MMO play on offer (solo leveling, solo instances, group instances/dungeons, raids, small group PvP, large group PvP, crafting, trading/AH flipping, and so on).  The systems all work fairly well, although there are still some bugs here and there as are to be expected in a new MMO.  Hopefully fewer of those on launch in a month&#8217;s time.  The setting is comic-book/cartoon style, and it doesn&#8217;t take itself that seriously (it&#8217;s filled with humor, actually), but this doesn&#8217;t mean it doesn&#8217;t require a good machine to run smoothly &#8211; it does.  And you will want to run it smoothly given all the quick movement and so on which the core mechanics of the game require.Class choices, because of the different core mechanic, are a bit different than in most MMOs, although there are similarities.  There is a warrior class, which is probably weaker than is generally the case in most MMOs due to the way that damage works in WildStar, as well as a closer range high damage class that could be compared to a rogue type class very roughly.  And then there are four ranged classes &#8211; an engineer (who has pets and heavy armor), a spellslinger (high burst damage, lots of micromanagement required for skills, so a higher skill cap class, can heal as well), a medic (ranged, but on the close side of ranged, decent DPS, and good healing skills) and an esper (very long range, lower mobility, plays more like a typical MMO mage, and can also heal).  Overall, the game, with its telegraphs and emphasis on movement, seems to favor classes which can stay out of the telegraph range and deal damage at range at the same time, but a skilled melee range player can likely do the same, with a bit more difficulty due to the core mechanic.  In general, there are enough classes here to keep a player who is a fan of the combat system happy for a while, I think.The game&#8217;s business model will feature a purchase price, and then either a $15 per month subscription fee, or the option for players who play a lot to purchase something called CREDD from other players for in-game currency (i.e., players who play less and want more currency will buy CREDD from the game company and then sell it to other players for in-game currency).  In-game currency can be used to purchase certain skill upgrades in the late game called AMPs, and so it does have an impact on gameplay.  In practice, this is the same model used by the highly successful EVE Online and its system of PLEX, but it may be less familiar to players who have not played EVE, and some may consider it to be a &#8220;pay-to-win&#8221; system, which it is not.Overall, the game impresses and feels solidly designed and made.  It could use a tad more polish, but that&#8217;s the case for most MMOs at launch.  The key question for a player thinking about this game is the degree to which they are either a twitch skill oriented gamer or, if they are not, the degree to which they are interested in playing a game which will require them to up their twitch skills considerably in order to be successful &#8211; because that is the core of the game, and the core attraction of it as well.NOTE:  Obviously this is based on the beta.  Things may change here and there before launch, and MMOs are always under change, so keep that in mind when reading this review.']\n",
            " [\"Pros: Overall it's a realatively polished game.  In terms of MMO gameplay, you get everything you would expect in the way of standard leveling and skill mechanics along with the traditional MMO class types.Cons: Unless you enjoy and have the time for large guild and raid involvement, there is not much in the way of end-game.  As a level 50 character, you are pretty much left with the option to raid (at which point you will need to be a member of a competent guild as the content is too hard for most PUGs), grind rep through a handful of dailies, and/or level alts.  This isn't necessarily the fault of Wildstar alone, however.  It's kind of the issue with most all MMOs.Personal Conclusion: If there were not already so many other options out there in the way of free-to-play MMOs, the game might be worth playing and investing some time in.  However, there are many other better options out there which do not require a monthly subscription.  I also personally am put off by NCSoft's decision to introduce the CREDD system into the game.  By adding CREDD into the game, NCSoft has done their standard micro-transaction greed grab.  The fact that they did this ON TOP of a subscription fee makes it all the worse.  In an attempt to mask this blatant greed, NCSoft and Carbine have tried to spin CREDD as a means for players to go &#34;free to play&#34; but that's not the true intent behind CREDD.  If it were, players would be able to buy CREDD through the use of in game gold outright and not have to rely on a separate player to FIRST buy CREDD for real money and attempt to sell it on the auction house.  In the end, the true purpose of CREDD is to allow an avenue by which NCSoft and Carbine can benefit through the sale of in game gold to players while also enjoying the umbrella of security afforded by monthly subscriptions.  NCSoft -- in turn -- feeds players' thirst for in game gold by keeping in game prices on most all items extremely high.  The result of this is pretty annoying for the average player who chooses not to purchase CREDD and try to sell it for in game gold.  Said players are stuck grinding gold non-stop while having the subscription timer hovering over your head.  If that's going to be the case, such players might as well invest their time elsewhere in other games that do not have a monthly subscription fee.Personally, if you are on the fence on whether or not to buy Wildstar, I would just say to wait a few more months and the game will likely go completely free-to-play (i.e. no subscription) since NCSoft would rather have people spending $20 a pop on CREDD vs. relying on only $15 /mo subscription players who may or may not partcipate in CREDD purchases.  Instead, NCSoft will remove the subscription fee to bring back all the players who have purchased the game (but refused to resub) in hopes that these returning players will -- in turn -- ultimately purchase CREDD.\"]\n",
            " ['I\\'ve played a lot of MMOs: Everquest, WoW, LOTRO, SW:TOR, Rift, Aeon, and GW2 to name a few.Wildstar is a wonderful addition to the MMO market. The graphics are colorful and extremely detailed, the soundtrack and characters are reminiscent of Firefly. The voice acting is outstanding and there is a ton of excellent humor embedded in interactions with NPCs, especially the \"Rez\" unit who constantly makes fun of you when you die and resurrect.You can customize your character much like other MMOs but with the difference being you can actually build hybrids depending on your play style. Another nice feature is that anyone can rez a fallen companion, no \"priest\" needed. There are some classes that are more suited to healing than others but I was very pleased to discover the healing classes can solo content nicely.There is a wide variety of things to do in the game making it seem like less of a grind to level. The combat system is exceptional and a lot of fun. Both you and your target \"telegraph\" you attacks/heals with a colored pattern on the ground indicating the range and area where your attack/heal will hit and when. Some attacks show an outline of the pattern which then fills solid to indicate when that attack will hit. This allows players to \"dash\" (roll) out of the way. Every attack has a different pattern and the attacks are random from mobs so you never quite know what to expect. So instead of standing in place and mashing button, you would do well to keep moving.The housing system is a lot of fun. You really can design your house just about anyway you want by taking an item and scaling it up or down and/or rotating any way you like and placing wherever you like. For example you could have your couch upside down and on the ceiling if that\\'s what you want.The crafting system is very clever as well and a lot of fun to use. You have your basic \"schematic\" (recipe) but then there are variations of the base recipe which you discover by adding combinations of ingredients. Once you hit the right combination, you have that recipe permanently in your file. But that combination of ingredients is custom to every character in game so you can\\'t find \"cheats\" online or copy the recipe from one toon to another.The dungeons are excellent with lots of challenges and include a \"Find a Group\" feature so it\\'s never difficult to get into a dungeon. I have not tried PvP yet as I\\'m still learning my characters but because of the amazing combat system, I can easily say the PvP will be a blast.The monthly subscription is very reasonable ($10.99 per/month if you purchase an annual subscription) however the game also has a unique feature that allows you to purchase \"CREDD\" with gold you earn while playing. So it is possible to play the game for free each month once you\\'ve purchased the base game.Wildstar seems to have combined the best elements of MMOs that came before it and tweaked and made each one even better. I highly recommend it to both seasoned veterans and newbies of MMOs as well.']\n",
            " [\"Due to my own fault I didn't realize there was a subscription at it's current price... with that said I think the game is put together well and think others will enjoy it.The vast majority of bad reviews happen to be those who haven't leveled all the way or even played the game so I suggest trying it out for yourself.If you've never played an MMO, leveling half way then giving an entire review is like looking at a car without driving it. The vast majority of game play is done AFTER you've leveled so that's the important part and that's where this game excels.The biggest complaint I find true would be the graphics. The actual objects and characters are modern, it's the landscape that people have an issue with. Frankly I don't get why that's such a giant deal. The game is extremely feature rich and isn't one where you can buy your way to the top like GW2 and legendaries.Know that there is a subscription, $15!!\"]\n",
            " ['Being a long time World of Warcraft player (on and off since it started) I am really liking WildStar.  It was created by a group of the original designers who made World of Warcraft and the similarity shows. As was stated in an interview early on with one of the developers, it is \"the game that we REALLY wanted to make, with no restraints from corporate...\".It is FUN!, VERY tongue-in-cheek humor, and has made me laugh out loud on several occasions. No their aren\\'t Orcs, cute Gnomes or Elves but it certainly has more than its share of cute toons you can play AND... you can play as a large ROCK guy! How awesome is that!. Kind of like World of Warcraft with most of the political correctness left out. You would never hear in WoW the announcer say, when you level up, \"THAT WAS (BLEEP)ING AWESOME! NOW YOU\\'RE A REAL BADASS!\" (yes they bleep out the first part of the word so the kiddies in the room don\\'t hear it). The first time I heard one of the level up announcements (and their all pretty funny) I was laughing so hard my wife came in to see what was going on.I also like the game play.  It is more like WoW used to be, that is before WoW was nerf\\'d so that it\\'s easier for the masses.  I am a casual gamer but I do like a bit of a challenge and WildStar delivers.  You feel like you earned the levels rather than just having them handed to you.  I am not a PvP player so I can\\'t address the PvP side of things.My suggestion is, if you are getting a bit bored with WoW, SWTOR or GW2, give Wildstar a shot. I think you will enjoy it.']\n",
            " [\"I am an old school Ulima Online Vet from MMO's who has played almost every major MMO out there. Wildstar is impressively polished, like WoW polished in terms of feel and look. The action route they pick for combat is different albeit not ground breaking.There is a ton of stuff to do for leveling, side quests and PVP. PVP for me was really lacking and was just dull. It was kind of like SWTOR fun at first but then really repetitive. I didn't make it to end game so take it with a grain of salt. I have a family and kids so I am not able to put the time into this game that I feel is required to be competitive.Graphics and sound are fine, cartoony but I think most know that going in.. Class balance seems fine for now except for a few bugs that need to be addressed (always happens with newer games). I didnt get into crafting much so I cant speak for that. Housing is a neat feature but it didn't really captivate me like Ultima Online did back in the day.. The whole instances thing really turns me off to the &#34;open world&#34; feeling..If your looking for a standard MMO with raiding, PVP etc this is a great game. I really just didnt find anything exciting or new offered here for me personally so I gave it three stars as its just OK for me personally....\"]\n",
            " [\"I purchased the deluxe edition and and didn't make it past level 20.  The tedium of walking along the countryside doing the atypical kill mobs for menial rewards to level up didn't fire my imagination.  In my current mmo i know the layout of the land and enjoy the lore, premise, legacy perks, and storyline.  Wildstar has much better customer support than what I'm used to and as a bonus English is their first language. While the specs for my pc far exceeded their minimal requirement I found the camera movement and controls too sluggish especially in the combat which was like tazmanian devil versus roadrunner.The whole Don Bluth / Ralph Bakshi look of the game is interesting but tends to overload the color cone receptors in the eyes after awhile.  When I made it to the capital hub of the exiles (space rednecks) called thayd.  There was so much going on I wasn't sure if it was my brain lagging or the graphics card.  An interesting break from my regular mmo but not my next place of residence.  The amount of gold spammers in the game and it not being F2P makes it hard to comprehend what it will be like when anyone can make an account without spending a dime.  Already dozens of fake emails have to be cleared out every time you log in.It's a good game and NCSOFT seem like good people but they project the attitude of constantly making fun of Sci-Fi just.  While other games try to make you a rock star in their universe the folks at carbine want you to know you are a girly cupcake and use derogatory and mildly defamatory remarks  every time you die in the game or level up.  I know it's supposed to be funny but since you the player are the punch line of the joke it really gets old.  Kind of like hitting the showers after a football game in high school and having the linebacker pee on you all in good fun.Nice attempt at a Wow version of Space Cowboy but I won't pay to subscribe.\"]\n",
            " [\"I've had this game since the head start, reached level 21, so the review will be based on what stood out to me so far.PRO- Engaging battle system - the battle system relies on you being able to aim at you enemies while avoiding their attacks.  There are area of effects graphics for your attacks as well the enemies, so you can't just button mash till they die, you're going to be dodging and trying to line up enemies for the right attacks.  A very engaging system.- Graphics/Story - right off I'll say that the graphics are very cartoonish, Personally I love it, they go really well with the tongue in cheek story so far.  I'm playing the dominion side which I'd describe as cheerfully evil.  More than once I've chuckled at the commentary when I've leveled up or died.- Player housing - I've just scratched the surface on this, but there seems to be a ton of customization.  I see myself wasting a lot of time/gold to get it just right.  As a long time Wow player, I've never really had or cared about housing.  But now that I have it in this game I see what all the fuss is about.- Challenge - I've only done one dungeon so far (in two attempts, more on that in CONS), and it was much more difficult than I was expecting.  Dungeons follow the trinity pattern with a tank, healer, and 3 DPS.  The fights are interesting, even down to the trash, where you better be able to move as well as know how to interrupt.  The successful run I went into was with a guild group, with mostly experienced (from other games) raiders so while we definitely had our fair share of wipes, we had enough awareness to be able to learn the fights and adapt our strategy to beat it.  Of course the downside to the challenge leads to....CONS- Not pug friendly for dungeons - I've only tried to pug one dungeon before, but yikes, it was a disaster.  In about 2.5 hours I think we went through 10-12 players and consistently people could not deal with the mechanics, would get frustrated and drop group.  Now maybe it's just going to take some time for people to learn what's expected, but currently you really have to coordinate the fights, and that is hard to do with pug groups.- Not solo quest friendly - with the active battle system you are going to need move... alot.  The mobs seem to be really close together, with lot of random patrols wandering as well.  As a result what starts as a nice easy pull against two enemies turn into a desperate struggle against 6 different mobs attack from different angels because while dodging against one enemy, I mistakenly pulled two more.  In a group it's not to big a deal, you can handle bigger pulls especially if you have a healer or tank toon, but solo..... well I've died quite a bit more than I was expecting in just getting through the first 20 levels.  Another issue right now is the spawn rate, it's a new game with lots of players, so the spawn rate is very high.  Plenty of times I've found myself backing away from my current target only to find the mob I just killed has re spawned behind me.  Like the dungeon difficulty, there is a degree of learning how to deal with this, but so far it's much more challenging than I had anticipated.  Oh and elites mixed in with the mobs.... they've got me plenty of times as well, lol.To kind of sum things up, I've found the game to be very enjoyable, but there is definitely a steeper learning curve than I was expecting as an experienced MMO player.  It hasn't quite convinced me to give up my other subscription MMO, but unlike all of the other recent releases I plan to be playing this beyond the initial month sub.\"]\n",

By chance you just want a new mmo that expands and expands it's world while you play you should check it out. Something I am a fan of is not having many load screens like FF games. What I do like are massive environments to play around in. This game accomplishes that goal for me. If you enjoy the basic mechanics to mmo's then you would be missing out if you don't check this out.I've played many mmo's going back all the way to UO. Played about 5 years with WoW but needed something different and haven't played that in probably 4 years. This does it for me.\"]\n",
            " [\"I was so disappointed with this game that i figured i wouldn&#8217;t even bother doing a review but all of these comments about how WoW players will love this game spurred me to speak up.  This is NOT the case.  At all.  Look on many wow forums and you will find many a person that thought this same thing and is now pretty upset about their purchase.  Don&#8217;t just hit the buy button before seeing the opinion of actual wow players not just people that think wow players are silly enough to like all cartoon style graphic games.I thought Wildstar was going to be my dream come true MMO, basically an updated version of World of Warcraft, but nothing could be father from the truth.  Don&#8217;t be fooled by the cartoon graphics, traditional quest/rep grinds, the raids and dungeons.  It may look a little similar to wow but it plays like a whole new genre of MMO.  Its a bit of a cross between an arcade game, a serenity comic book, and an MMOPG really.Combat:  Because of the &#8216;telegraph&#8217; system basically every class plays like an AOE rogue.  Heavy armor, light armor, what ever, it doesn't matter, if you don&#8217;t move our of the way of enemy attacks, and keep moving, you will die.  There is no class that can keep mobs at range or a class that can simply stand and fight everyone is an AOE rogue with a frustratingly inadequate CC ability.  Combat is fast paced and demands near constant movement.  Unfortunately this makes all of the classes feel pretty much the same.Group Combat:  Best described as a 70&#8217;s disco nightmare.  Spell effects all over the place, 5 - 40 peoples telegraphs lighting up the floor and spinning flashing whirling boss telegraphs and tornados all over the place.  Very flashy, very very fast paced.  It requires good hand eye coordination and top notch reflexes.  This stuff is not for the faint of heart and it is especially difficult if you have no voice communication between party members as some abilities need to be timed off of each other.  To make matters worse at end game some of the dungeons, (all?) are timed and need to be completed with top scores to earn end game raid gear points.  A recipe for disaster with pick-up groups.  Why did they make a whole multi million dollar game to cater to 1% of the mmo player base?  I have no idea.  Suffice it to say if you are over the age of 28 or so no matter how strategic or knowledgable you are you probably will not be exceptional at this game.  It&#8217;s just a reflex thing, you can&#8217;t fix that.  You get older, your reflexes slow, simple biology.Graphics:  Personally i love the cartoon look for MMORPG&#8217;s.  This was not a negative for me.  What was a negative was the weird scail.  Its hard to describe.  There dosnt seem to be any consistent scale in the game.  Some items, like settler tents, are too small for a toon to step under, some areas are set to character scale, and most things are set to a x5  scale.  There is no constant and one is left with a mish-mash of contradicting environmentals that just leaves me a bit lost and feeling like I&#8217;m just wondering around in clutter.  Honisly I&#8217;m not sure how to describe the scale thing but i do know its&#8230;.odd and disjointed.  And speaking of clutter&#8230;.  It&#8217;s all over the place and very little of it is actually purposeful.  The color pallet in many ares is over saturated and brite and too big or too small and its all over the place.  The world environment is just over all disjointed.  I do really like how they made some zones bright, colorful and silly.The World:  There are sufficient zones for a newly released game i think and the variety is bang on.  Good job there.  The mob placement on the other hand&#8230;there is just no breathing space.  One is left with very little incentive to wander as you have to fight your way forwared foot by foot most of the time.  It&#8217;s frustrating as the landscapes are beautifully done and begging for exploration.  In addition there are several areas that are quite difficult to navigate and the map is near useless.  The whole thing, though beautiful, is over crowded and leaves you feeling a bit like you are on a quest treadmill.Travel:  Insufficient travel hot spots.  Walking feels slow and even the mounts feel sluggish.  The double jump is too die for!  the double space suit jump is &#8230;awe inspiring.  Who ever did the work on the movement equations is a genus.Questing:  It&#8217;s the usual.  I really like how there is a zone quest line, a world quest line, and zone tasks.  For the most part you can level using just the zone and world quests but i really enjoyed mixing in some tasks as well and they are great for zone rep.  The quest system is not ground breaking but honestly this was not a huge deal to me.  I would have preferred a game with just the zone, world, and gear quests with public events and mob kill experience to fill in the gap but what they have is fine.Loot:  Mobs drop loot (Hooray!) and crafting goods but the exp you gain from them is not sufficient to warrant killing them unless you have a quest.  I was excited to look for random world drops of housing items but was very disappointed to find that most of these items (?) are purchased from a housing vender or are tied to rep venders in each zone.  It&#8217;s possible there are items tied to areas but as of this writing there is no information about that.  So, not happy loot hunting unfortunately.Gear:  A cluster **** of confusing stats and caps and rune crafting and amp&#8217;s and god knows what else.  You will need to do some research to figure out what all of these things mean to play effectively.  Funny that just as WoW is realizing that convoluted and confusing does not equal &#8216;hard-core&#8217; Wildstar is going the other way.  The rune system is this games gear enchanting and starts early in the game.  Honestly after 10 years of MMO&#8217;s i couldn&#8217;t figure it out.  It was not fun and intuitive and i don&#8217;t play games to work..so&#8230;.i passed on it.Crafting:  oh crafting&#8230;its so sad.  If wow is too simple, and lets face it, it really is, Wildstar is over the top fiddly, time consuming, excessively expensive, and frustrating.  It&#8217;s so convoluted i won&#8217;t even try to go into everything going on there.  Just suffice it to say it&#8217;s not an improvement on wow crafting.  The only positive i have in this area is that i like how a character can switch crafting skills and not loose their progress.  Do check out the amusing crafting by the Hot and Cold game videos on youtube.  Who even thinks of this stuff?  Why would they do this?  You keep crafting getting hotter and hotter till you find the recipe.  Each try takes gold AND crafting supplies.  Eventually you hit the mark&#8230;only to have it randomize the next time you try to craft the same thing.  The only benefit to recipe discovery in the game is that you have a general idea of where the hot area is next time.  sigh.  really?  Anyway, like i said it's very hard to explain.  Also, get this,  there are four different UI&#8217;s for basic crafting.  Four. Only one of them, the circuit board crafting interface, is intuitive and easy to navigate.Gathering:  I like the mechanics of it but they limited it so that one gathering skill takes up one of your two crafting slots.  Very traditional, but in my opinion, outdated.  Unfortunately as of the date I&#8217;m writing this the end game gathering areas have been hacked by teleporting bots so there are virtually no resources available to be gathered.  Interestingly, Im pretty sure you don&#8217;t need to take a gathering skill to gather,  I think i just makes gathering more effective and quicker&#8230;but don&#8217;t quote me on this.  Like I said, very little info about the game mechanics are available at this time.  And isn&#8217;t THAT a whole different complaint catagory.UI:  My guess is that they expected the user base to fix this with add-on&#8217;s.  it was horrible, they did a new iteration a few weeks before launch.  Basically the end ui was not beta tested.  Why would they not beta their ui? At any rate it&#8217;s pretty bad.  Maps are less then helpful.  On the brite site the built in optional quest arrows, similar to, but better than, the wow tom-tom add-on, are fantastic.Housing:  Its fantastic.  the variety of housing items is amazing and the customization options are fabulous.  Here is the clincher though.  While decorative elements are yours to keep forever, housing &#8216;plugs' that add functionality are one use items.  What is the point of an uber rare epic housing plug (yes they do exist) that you can never ever ever change or redecorate? Once you chose to put it on on your land if you change your mind and want to move it, or just put something else there for a day or two its gone forever.  It&#8217;s a bittersweet experience.  Adding to that is that, as of this date, there is no information about what is available and how to find it even if you know its in the game.  Im guessing this is another thing they are counting on the player base to fix with online databases or something.  So, housing is wonderful and wonderfully implemented,  sure it has some bugs here and there but its the best so far in the genre so who cares?  The down side about the one use items though is a killer for me.  I love collecting rare in game items but seriously who would bother if it's a one use thing and you can&#8217;t ever redecorate?

            " [\"This game is Vanilla WoW (and Burning crusade in my opinion) Re imagined, with amazing and creative editions that make it more fun.Now before you Wildstar fans freak out on me, please understand Carbine has said the same thing.I'm also not talking about the graphics as well (comparing it to Vanilla WoW), which are beautiful and fit the universe extremely well.Please haters out there, please stop throwing insults at this game because it didn't try to reinvent the MMO wheel. Just zip it. This isn't guild wars 2, and Carbine never tried to say that was their plan.Take the game for what it is, a refined and extremely fun game of things that have existed in other MMOs past and currently. That isn't to say there isn't a original feel to this game, and Carbine isn't original -- there are plenty examples. Just please don't log in expecting this game to reinvent MMOs. Chess has being reinvented, or the board game GO. Sometimes a system just works.Sorry, this won't be short.Graphics: They are beautiful and fit the world perfect. I have read where many people complain about the cartoon feel of the game. So what? Just because you don't like something, it doesn't make it bad. It's a beautiful game, maxed out and all the way down to medium.Performance : To me this is the biggest, and only flaw Wildstar has, the Optimization is better, but it still sucks overall. I might be because, they built a new engine from scratch. It could be because AMD or Nvidia struggles with this game, and until they optimize the drivers, it will deliver uneven performance. Regardless, this game gets Wild (pun intend) reports results on performance, on monster rigs and bad rigs. Even Carbine said, it's a problem they are working on. So it isn't my opinion.The only reason it gets one star off. I have a AMD 290 and It lags in certain aspects of the game. In large PVP fights, and 40 man raids.Gameplay :  The most original aspect of this game and the most fun. Works as a failure filtration system. You either become a better player, or rage and quit. The combat here, isn't like wow, it's a trigger based, reaction combat system. If you stand in one place, and don't like to move. This game will not be kind to you. This creates a better MMO in my opinion and community. PUG groups struggle now, but will get better in the future. It will filter the bad players out in general.I do think one concern hold weight. Bad graphic performance and latency can ruin the game for some, and it could be a larger problem the a minority of players. I personally think this won't be a issue, but it's possible.Dungeons: Do you miss the days when Dungeons were a challenge? Where you couldn't just click various buttons without hotkeys? Where you couldn't sleep through them and still succeed? Then this game is for you. At level 20 you get to indulge in your first dungeon, they are very hard and have the fun to match. This will also clear out the Dungeon Finder wow people, who are used to sleep through dungeons. Dungeon bots won't live long in this game. They are fun and extremely rewarding.Raids : Miss the old days of raiding in Vanilla and Burning Crusade? Like heroic raiding in WoW but dislike the game they have built around it? Don't like the concept of a random group raid finder system? Then these raids are for you! There is no easy button mode on this game, and the raids are gated content. World of Warcraft was a better game, when gated raids existed (there was more subs), and So is Wildstar. Also if you have been missing 40 man raids? I know I have been over the years, and this game is perfect for me. They also over 20 man raids.Housing: If you love spending hours on a house decorating and fixing up you property (that floats in the sky). This is another addon that will appeal to you.Non group content : So many you aren't interested in group content like raids, PVP, or dungeons. There is a delusion this game doesn't offer anything outside that. Wrong.  There are solo entrances (dungeons) that exist in the game, that you can by all by your lonesome. Problem solved. There is also the housing I already mentioned. These are two of the many examples that exist in game.PVP: Warplots is the most original concept brought to the MMO genre in a long time. They are amazing and allow people to craft their own battlegrounds and pvp matches. If you miss large scale PVP of 40 vs 40 players this is the game for you.Closing : Wildstar is a brilliant game that offers a fun amazing experience, as long as you don't expect Carbine is reinvent the wheel. This is a MMO that's fun, has a wonderful personality and bring challenge back to a genre that has generally focused on casual players. It's nice to see a focus on Hardcore players again.It offers amazing group content, just as amazing solo content, and everything in between.In my opinion it offers everything MMO player with a bit of skill can hope for. It's not casual friendly, meaning if you don't want to get any better and prefer mindless farming, such as what WoW offers -- this isn't the game for you.When I say casual I don't mean, you have limited time to play. What I mean is people who scream for nerfs, don't want to improve, want easier content, and everything to be handed to them. Like WoW has involved into. This game isn't for those people and it's a good thing and no surprise the game's community is awesome.What should be lost is Carbine always listens to their players, they care, and have built a great game around player feedback. Carbine listens, has a open door policy, and will straight up tell you about good and bad things going on. They aren't a political giant that plagues the MMO industry, where they never say what they mean and hide things from their fan base.The end result is you have is a great game in every way. That is only hindered by something that can only improve in time. Graphic performance. It needs to be optimized overall, and even then some people run the game fine. It comes down to what's playable for you personally as a member of the master race. One more thing to have, the combat adds to the game's strength, and you could make a argument is the best thing about it.However, I have to consider the possible weakness of the system as well. When you have a trigger based system, that is dependent on the game not only performing graphic wise great, any lag will mean death. Especially in raids.Also, latency can also be a killer as well. If you live in a bad area, or have poor internet, I can see this being the killer of people as well, especially in PVP and Raids. If you lag in any or both respects you cannot compete with other players.This means if you have the best performing graphics and no latency, you will have an advantage of over players in pvp and pve.We will have to see if this impacts the future of the game at all, but seems to be a decent theory.Regardless I have to take, the graphics and potential weakness of the combat system, as great as it is into consideration.Score : 8.5 out of 10.Wildstar is the best MMO released in years, that caters to the hardcore mmo player in every way -- if you don't expect it to reinvent the wheel.Still it struggles in terms of graphics performance and optimization. At best delivering uneven performance across all systems.That; along with a player with below average internet service, could potentially hurt their performance in raids and pvp. Due to the nature of a trigger/reaction based combat system.With that said, even that can't distract from the fact, for my money it's the best MMO released since the Original World Of Warcraft.\"]\n",
            " [\"So I make it a point of beta testing every new MMO I can get my hands on, I've been playing MMOs in one form or another for at least a decade now and have beta tested almost every major MMO that has come out during that time. Most MMO's don't pass my beta test scratch n' sniff -- meaning I test them, but the game fails to impress me, so I don't invest in it further.I went into Wildstar beta not expecting much. The science-fiction based genre really didn't appeal to me. However, I finished beta weekend thoroughly impressed -- so much so that I pre-ordered the deluxe edition of the game.The game hits all the familiar bells and whistles with questing and adventures, but it has many layers to ensure the longevity of its legacy. There are literally hundreds of quests, pvp, battlegrounds, crafting, cool looking mounts -- all the stuff you've come to expect from a decent subscription-based MMO. But there's also a customizable housing element, that has drawn in players that normally don't pay much attention to that sort of thing.When you look at a new MMO, you want something that has the potential to entertain for a long time -- particularly when you are paying a monthly sub. This game appears to have many different avenues to occupy and delight (I say appears because nobody has seen end-game yet). However, the developers come from some pretty significant and successful MMOs, so I would expect them to pay particular attention to end-game content. When I played Wildstar, I could see that there was more to do besides just linear questing -- that was important for me in my decision to purchase and sub. I wanted a game where I could see myself playing for longer than a month  -- not just gobble up the content, get bored and move on to the next big thing.The gameplay itself takes a bit of getting used to with its telegraph system -- but once you get into the swing of the mechanics it flows intuitively enough.The world itself is massive -- we were only allowed to level 17 in this past beta weekend and there was more than enough to keep players occupied. Visit the Wildstar website for details on classes and races and cities.What hooked me though, was the game's humour. There are times when you will spit out your coffee by the shocking narrator's comments -- they are so campy, hilarious and unexpected. The narrator takes great delight in your death, the game's foibles, your ability to level -- but it's a love-hate thing. I, myself, love the narrator, he cracks me up because he's so cliche, but others are not as keen.Overall, this game shows promise, even in this day and age where the F2P model is king. I would highly recommend giving it a try.\"]\n",

It comes with the game, a code key that you can link with your smart phone to get free teleports in game, some cool art cards and a stellar art book, a CD of game tunes, and a movie as well. It was definitely a thoughtfully crafted set.The game itself is a ton of fun. You can pretty much solo your way around as you like, you can join a Free Company, pick up quests that team you with other players, etc...while you are wandering, you can decide to help people in the midst of their own battles if you like. There are also Fate events, which are essentially free for alls, in that anybody near the event can participate and reap the benefits of doing so. There is absolutely no shortage of quests, and although you choose your class initially, you can pursue any and/or all of them if you want, from the more standard adventuring classes to crafting classes and so on. This really adds an incredible diversity and variety of gameplay. There is also an actual storyline and endgame to pursue. I havent wrapped it up yet, but what I've done of it so far has been quite impressive. The combat is quite intuitive and I suppose fairly basic overall, although implementing strategies depending on your preferred gameplay increase the complexity of it all.There are achievements both in game and for PSN. They arent necessarily the same ones. I'm not sure why this is, but it is what it is.I played the beta on PS3 and PC previously, and also own the PC version, but for me, the PS4 version is superior. For one, the controller is intuitive, and the touch screen also functions as a mouse for those things that require it. I really like the way the game is set up for the PS4 controller. It's easy to use and never requires you to fumble around. The graphics are stunning.All in all, I am very pleased with this and having the first 30 days free allows me (and you) the ability to play through the endgame and hang it up, or decide to stick with it to see what else the game may offer in the future.Anyways, I'll be happy to answer any questions if you care to ask, as best I can.Cheers\"]\n",

Also,  I did not despair over thelack of character customization. I had enough to work with, honestly. The graphics are so-so because some areas and characters are detailrd better than others. Eolas, Buffallo,  and Rhelmar seemed to be the most detailed. However, face 1 for the protagonist was detailed quite well.I used a surround sound headset and I could hear the music quite well. It was amazingly done. Many tracks were very calming while others set the tone for intense moments with great bass. I would buy the OST if they sold it.Voice-acting is mediocre but not terrible like some claim.I'm on my third playthrough upping the difficulty each time. The game is extremely challenging. A couple hits can kill you on Buffalo and Captain difficulty. It isn't impossible to finish though.The level-up trees are impossible though. You can honestly only max out one. I tried two trees like IGN claimed, but you are left with a few empty slots on each tree. Trophies require you to max out each tree but that would mean three playthroughs.Romancing a companion is available in Bound by Flame. It doesn't reveal much, just a short scene usually involving a kiss and then blacking out. It still is exciting to choose who you wish to romance and support.Overall, the game is praise-worthy. The demonic transformation is awesome to speculate as you make choices. The soundtrack is addicting and memorable. I suggest buying this and supporting this new developer for future gems to come. 7/10.\"]\n",
            " [\"While this is not an AAA title or franchise, it has its moments. Unfortunately, it falls into too many usability traps to make it a truly good game.The game suggests itself to be an RPG, but it's really just a third person zombie-esque hack and slasher with some RPG elements thrown in.  The enemies are nothing special. The RPG elements and leveling pieces just seem to be add-ons. However, the combat is okay. But, let's get right down to what's wrong with this title.The graphics are weak and uninspired. In fact, this looks like a title that could have been on the Xbox 360 without any significant problems. This is one of the primary problems with this game. However, the main problem is the boss levels. As with many lower budget games, they go overboard by throwing you into a heavily tutorial-laced intro. This isn't so much a problem in that it's expected with most games, it just that this game constantly interrupts the game play so frequently you cannot even play. In fact, I had to turn the tutorial system off (thankfully there's a setting).  Worse, the tutorial intro requires you to use each of your actions to make sure you understand how to use them ... when, in fact, you should be conserving the use of your finite items (like health).However, when you need to actually get down to business and play the game, you cannot because of some stupid design decisions. Yes, the game offers you ways to crafting things such as weapons, armor and health. Though, there are no health pickups on the level, you must craft them. The trouble is, no components are to found to actually make health potions. So, while you're forced to use up all your given health potions just getting through the intro, you cannot make any more. After having used up all of the health potions just trying to clear the enemies leading up to the first boss, you are left without any health potions when confronting the first boss.Also, after you get through the lead up to the boss, you will acquire what seems like it should be an awesome power. Instead, it's just a magic spell to enchant your weapons or throw fireballs. Worse, the spell wears off fast and takes far too long to cast. This newfound power doesn't help you in any way. At least if you're going to empower the player character, at least make it count.But, this isn't the real problem. The real problem is that because you cannot craft any new potions (no components) and you cannot back out of the boss level to go search (not that you'd find any), you're stuck there. On top of boss attacking you with various techniques, which you have to destroy him by hacking his hands and feet at opportune times... all the while the level is constantly throwing waves of archers,  mace and sword wielding zombies that never end (which also consume health). Because the game traps you into a level without health pickups and with no way to actually complete it, the only thing you can do is start the entire game over with a completely new tactic... conserve your potions at all costs. Something you wouldn't know to do based on the tutorial.And therein lies this game's fundamental problem and why it's getting 2.5 stars. If you're a game developer who wants to design a shooter, don't do it this way. If you're going to force a boss level at the end, then you frickin' well better give enough components along the way to craft enough health to win it. Or alternatively, offer health pickups on the boss level. Trapping the player on a boss level without any health is just insane. Who would ever do this other than people who just don't 'get' how to create video games? Forcing the player to start the entire game over just to choose a new tactic to survive the boss level is just stupid. Think through game design people. Trial and error gaming is never cool.It's clear that this game wasn't in any way play tested. I would give this game 2.5 stars, but there's no way to give that here.

The only issues I came across was one bugged quest (The Barricade) and a glitch during the battle with the Blades&#8217; Captain where I fell through the ground and was stuck on a black screen with no way to progress without shutting down the console and restarting the quest over again.Although the snarky dialog (awkwardly peppered with profanities and &#8220;F&#8221; bombs) was obviously scripted to appeal to a more juvenile gamer audience, it was still a FUN game offering challenging boss fights that required thoughtful strategy and careful planning in regard to inventory, skill sets and companion abilities.While I&#8217;m personally not a big fan of overly tedious inventory and crafting/upgrading systems, I do enjoy taking the time to thoroughly explore the game world and its branching storyline.  Rather than plowing through the game just to see how fast I could beat it, I took the time to grind my way through all the side quests made available --- adding HOURS of gameplay to the ticket price.  In that regard, one certainly can&#8217;t complain about the game not being long enough!Add to that some replay value, above average graphics, decent combat mechanics, a comprehendible story, and the ability to craft your own player character with even the most basic gender/ethnicity options&#8230; and (for me) Bound by Flame was certainly worth every penny of its release price.']\n",

            " ['Bound by Flame has been on my radar for the last year.  I have been eagerly waiting while paying close attention for new information in every press release.  Now, the time has finally arrived and Bound by Flame is out and I couldn\\'t have been more excited to get the chance to review it.Fantasy role-playing games are one of the most common genres on the market today, probably only behind the likes of first-person shooters.  So, with new fantasy RPGs coming out all the time, you could easily feel like you are drowning while trying to play them all.  That has been the case for me over the past few years.  Games like Skyrim, Dragon Age II, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, Dark Souls II, and The Witcher II: Assassins of Kings are all great games in their own right, but they didn\\'t grab me the way I hoped that they would.  The only one on that list that did was Kingdoms of Amalur and it only did because it had the most fun combat system I have ever played in an RPG.  Because of the bad taste left in my mouth by these HUGE blockbuster games, I was skeptical about the possibility of Bound by Flame changing my mind.  Sure, the screenshots and trailers looked pretty cool, but how many times have we been burned by previews like that?  The only glimmer of hope I have been holding on to was that Bound by Flame is developed by Spiders, a small French video game development studio known for games like Of Orcs and Men and Mars: War Logs.  Maybe a small team could develop the perfect fantasy RPG that I have been waiting for.The story in Bound by Flame has a Game of Thrones feel to it, but not in the sense that there is a war between five kings. Instead you should think about the \"White Walkers\".  For those of you who are not familiar with Game of Thrones, the \"White Walkers\" are a race of mythical humanoid creatures that possess magical powers, look akin to zombies, and have a history of waging war on mankind.  The Bound by Flame counterpart to the \"White Walkers\" are the Deadwalkers: an army of rotting, deformed, and downright disgusting zombie-like creatures.  The Deadwalkers were summoned over 150 years ago by the Lords of Ice, who are hell-bent on conquering the world of Vertiel.  The Lords of Ice are a circle of mysterious immortal necromancers who have been successfully leading their legions of undead in the extermination of all other known races.The world of Vertiel was once bountifully populated by humans, elves, dwarves, and the like; however by the time you begin your quest, most of the sentient lifeforms have been wiped off the map and unwillingly joined the Deadwalker army.  You play as Vulcan, an upstart human mercenary with a bad attitude and a lot of sass.  Vulcan belongs to a faction of respected human mercenaries called the Pure-Blades, who are tasked with protecting what\\'s left of the Red Scholars-an ancient Order of mages who are considered to be the last chance of stopping the impending apocalypse brought on by the vicious bloodlust of the Lords of Ice.While protecting the Red Scholars during a ritual intended to stop the Lords of Ice, all hell breaks loose.  Vulcan accidentally ends up on the wrong side of a Demon summoning spell and becomes possessed.  The Demon inside Vulcan is trapped, and has no choice but to help our hero if he chooses to accept it.  As the fight against the Lords of Ice and the Deadwalkers progress, Vulcan is constantly tormented by the Demon, tempting him to give up his humanity in order to gain unheard-of levels of magical powers.I was overwhelmingly obsessed with finding out every little detail about the history of the world and the war with the Undead.  Spiders did a fantastic job at establishing both compelling lore and an awesome story.  I found myself talking to every single character, while making sure to investigate all dialogue options so as not to miss any of the story. Most of the story is told through these dialogue investigations, so if you decide to skip them you will surely miss out.  I wanted to know who the Lords of Ice were, why they were waging war on the entire planet, and who the hell the Demon was that possessed Vulcan.Bound by Flame has an excellent fantasy story; but that being said, I fear that many players may not enjoy spending as much time diving deep into conversations as I did.  By no means is the story told solely through NPC interaction though; you will get the overall picture just by playing and only talking to NPCs necessary for each main quest.  However, there is no way you will enjoy just how rich the story can be by doing this.When comparing Bound by Flame\\'s story to the story of Skyrim, there are obvious similarities in story progression and themes.  However, the aspect that sets Bound by Flame apart from Skyrim (and the myriad of other fantasy RPG clones) is that Bound by Flame does not bother overloading you with thousands of meaningless sidequests.  I will admit, I was once a gamer obsessed with finishing every single sidequest in every game just to say I did it, but that is not the case anymore.  I simply do not have the time or the patience to spend hundreds of hours completing fetch quests and other throwaway chores for characters you will never speak to again.Bound by Flame is exactly what I have been looking for.  Sure, there are sidequests in every camp you enter, but there are a very limited number of them.  Further, most of these are somehow tied to your party members or even to the overarching main storyline.  I was able to complete both the main questline and the majority of the sidequests available in just over 25 hours.  Even if you take your time and attempt to do everything, you will still only clock in about 30-35 hours.  This is the perfect formula for a great fantasy RPG and I commend Spiders for hitting nail on the head.For a game that has been flying under the radar by most of the gaming world, Bound by Flame looks absolutely gorgeous. Many developers these days take the easy way out and use the same color palette throughout the entirety of their game.  Spiders did not abide by these rules and instead built a world made up of incredibly diverse environments.  Each of these environments were beautiful and used different colors to show off their differences.  Even the dreary environments like swamps were and caverns were alluring if you take the time to inspect the detail.However, when comparing Bound by Flame\\'s delightful art style and color palette to that of other games in the genre, it doesn\\'t quite compare the the photorealism that many of these games have achieved in recent years.  With that said, it doesn\\'t take away anything from the game as Spiders studio created an awesome visual style of their own.The voice talent in Bound by Flame is headlined by the established and excellent Robin Atkin Downes as Vulcan.  Downes plays the part to perfection and makes it easy for players to connect with Vulcan and really feel involved in the story.  The entire cast followed Downes amazing lead, making each character interaction that much more enjoyable.  The only downside to these interactions is that there is almost no lip syncing in the game.  If you pay close attention, you will notice that characters mouths will just freely move as they speak and will not look realistic in the least.  The lack of lip syncing was not detrimental to the overall experience for me because I read the subtitles as characters talk instead of watching their faces; but it is obvious that it will be an issue for some players.Speaking of the audio performance in Bound by Flame, I would be remiss to not talk about the soundtrack.  You know a soundtrack has done its job when it delivers tension and emotion at just the right moments.  That is exactly what composer Olivier Derivi&egrave;re (known for his work on Assassin\\'s Creed and Remember Me) was able to do with this soundtrack.  As catchy as most of Bound by Flame\\'s songs are, you will quickly notice that there aren\\'t a whole lot of them.  You will spend a lot of time in each environment so by the time you have completed each section of the game, you have probably heard the same songs played repeatedly for hours.  The collection of songs you will experience really are superb at establishing the perfect mood for each environment and aspect of the story; I just wished that there was a larger variety of them when it was all said and done.The question that everyone has been asking when inquiring about Bound by Flame has been \"What is the combat system like?\"  To put it simply, I would describe it as being fun, strategic, and a little difficult if you are not paying close attention to what you are doing.  Bound by Flame is not a game where you can run into a large group of enemies and just hack-and-slash your way to victory with no second thought.  In fact, that is the easiest way to find yourself dying quicker than the amount of time it took you to run into them.Strategically using your assortment of combat abilities and weapons is the most vital aspect of winning against even the most mundane battles with mobs of weak Deadwalkers and beasts roaming the land.  You can freely choose between a sword, axe, hammer, daggers, a crossbow, explosive traps, and fire magic to help you get the upper hand on enemies.  Bound by Flame is packed full of different mob level enemies that all have different attack patterns and special abilities.  As you progress, you will have to learn their patterns and what weapons are most useful against them or accept your inevitable fate as becoming one of the undead.The strategy required to defeat the many different beasts and Deadwalkers increases tenfold when you encounter a boss fight.  Spiders did a great job when designing their terrifying set of bosses.  Each major boss fight was incredibly unique when compared to the previous boss you encountered.  Not only are each of them horrifyingly creepy looking, but they also all have different combat styles as well.  If you are anything like me, you will find yourself dying often each time you encounter a boss until you can finally develop a well-oiled strategy.  Often the most rewarding part of defeating a boss was the feeling of satisfaction from working out the perfect strategy.Based on how I described the combat system, you may think that it will be really hard, but that really isn\\'t the case.  I have never been a fan of hard games, and Bound by Flame never felt like it was approaching that territory.  I always felt like I was just one second or one move away from figuring out how to kill each enemy or boss.  This caused me to immediately jump back in and try a different strategy until I could finally work it out.Armor and weapon customization will often determine whether you live or die in any given skirmish.  Bound by Flame has an incredibly deep loot system which lets you use just about any item you find to upgrade your equipment.  These upgrades will not only add statistic boosts like attack power or physical resistance, but they will also completely change the way that specific piece of equipment looks.  Needless to say, it was awesome to see Vulcan go from having raggedy amor in the beginning to looking like he could rule the world by the end.  Aside from the huge variety of cosmetic differences in weapons and armor, you will want to pay close attention to each statistic you are upgrading because some will prove to be your best weapon against certain enemies, while others will be your Achilles\\' Heel.The leveling system and skill trees are very straight forward and include no real surprises or innovation when compared to other RPGs.  Vulcan gains experience and levels up by defeating enemies.  After leveling up, you can choose to put skill points in any of the three available skill trees: a heavy weapon warrior skill tree, a dagger and crossbow ranger skill tree, and the Demon\\'s fire magic skill tree.  On top of that, you will also have the ability to use an additional skill point on a passive skill that can improve things like how often you find ingredients or how much items will cost at a merchant.  Nothing really crazy stood out about the leveling or skill trees, but it was well done all the same.The Verdict: 9 out of 10Bound by Flame is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise crowded genre.  Spiders has achieved what many developers fail to ever do: creating a beautiful world with an incredibly deep/interesting history while also including a rock solid fun combat system.  Even though you can complete the main story and most of the sidequests in about 30 hours, many players will find themselves diving right back into the game to try and achieve the other two endings.  Bound by Flame was everything I wanted it to be and then some.  Spiders did an absolutely fantastic job and I hope that gamers will realize this so that we might see a sequel in the near future.  How do I sum up the entire game in just three words?  \"Go buy it.\"Courtney Osborn is the Founder and Editor in Chief at Middle of Nowhere Gaming.']\n",

            " [\"I'm a huge fan of the RPG.  I love games like Skyrim, Dark Souls, Witcher, etc.  I have all of these games for XBOX360.  Bound by Flame for the PS4 couldn't hold any of those game's jock.  This game fails in so many ways.  For starters, let's talk about the presentation.  The graphics are terrible.  Next gen systems should be embarrassed to have this game played on them.  It looks like a very early PS3 title.  Not only does the game look bad, but it sounds worse.  The voice acting is laughable.  One character sounds like he's British, another like he's from Brooklyn, NY.  And I don't typically have an aversion for swearing in a video game, but the dialogue in BBF is rampant with unnecessary F-bombs.The gameplay is average at best.  The game is linear and the story is convoluted.  Fighting mechanics are ok, despite poor controller mapping.  It can be challenging, particularly early on in the game.  You'll likely die often if played on the normal difficulty level.  It has a decent level up system and looting aspects.  That's about it for the positives, if you can call them positives.If you have a PS4 and are extremely bored due to lack of released titles and you MUST pick this up, consider yourself warned.  I'd highly recommend waiting for the price point to drop below $25 before doing so.  Based on how badly is sucks, I assume that shouldn't take long.\"]\n",
            " ['Let&#8217;s not set unrealistic expectations, here.  Bound by Flame is NOT a highly-polished, AAA game.  This is, by all accounts, a very ambitious indie game in disguise.  Developer Spiders wasn&#8217;t trying to compete with the likes of Dragon Age or The Witcher (at least, I hope they weren&#8217;t&#8230;wow, haha).  However, what you get here isn&#8217;t bad at all and given the lack of options when it comes to RPG&#8217;s on the PlayStation 4, I found this game scratched that itch in a very satisfactory way.  The game has every semblance of what you&#8217;d expect in a Witcher/Dragon Age type game:  the dark fantasy vibe, elves, warriors, grotesque creatures&#8230;and of course you have open world structures like side quests, crafting, and upgrading.  There are definitely some half-baked ideas here and there, but pretty much everything from the story to the gameplay works just well enough to be serviceable and not a tiny bit more.The story has to do with destroying an Ice Lord and journeying to a magical netherworld called the Worldheart.  Honestly, the story isn&#8217;t anything to write home about and I can&#8217;t really say it was memorable in any way.  You create a character (with very limited options), and begin your journey.  You are quickly introduced to the battle system, which works in two stances you can switch between, plus the magic and stealth aspects you can add to them.  The warrior stance is for big swords, axes, etc. where you strike more slowly and powerfully, while the rogue stance uses daggers and is light, quick and less powerful.  Each stance has its own skill tree you can upgrade once you level up.  There is also Pyromancy, which adds fire (the only spell) to your attacks and/or defense.  That has a skill tree as well.  Combat pretty much boils down to a standard attack, an area-wide attack, blocking and dodge/kick.  Nothing very deep, but as I said earlier it&#8217;s functional.  The only thing that&#8217;s sorely missing is an evade move which would come in handy many times over.  It is really the biggest oversight by the developers.  I should definitely mention that this isn&#8217;t a button masher.  In combat, you MUST exercise caution and use your blocks and parries.  Simply mashing square is a surefire way to get yourself killed, especially in boss fights later in the game.  There are multiple difficulty levels, and they can definitely provide a tough challenge.  After getting reamed, I went from normal to easy, and even then the final boss took about 30 tries.One of the best-designed aspects of this game is the surprisingly useful crafting system.  To be blunt, crafting is how you get stuff done.  Need health or mana potions?  Just craft them!  Crafting materials are found literally everywhere from random chests and stashes to enemy drops.  This also applies to weapons and armor.  You also find Gold to buy things at shops, but shops and currency may as well not exist.  Gold is exceedingly rare and shops are prohibitively expensive.  But that doesn&#8217;t matter because 99% of the time the armor and weapons found at shops are far below your current stats, and the gear you find out in the wild is far better.  Any gear you find can be recycled into components for crafting upgrades, and that is always your best bet.  In essence you are your own &#8220;shop&#8221;&#8230;you can literally craft anything you will ever need on the spot.The writing and characters are, as expected, decent enough to keep you interested.  Amusingly, one particular character is pretty much a blatant rip-off of Morrigan from Dragon Age: Origins.  The voice acting can be pretty wooden, but you shouldn&#8217;t be expecting Uncharted-type acting in a game like this.  The game does contain a bit of profanity, but I actually saw that as part of its charm.  The dialogue is ever so slightly out-of-character for the setting and lore, but I loved that about it.  The game just doesn&#8217;t take itself too seriously.  The graphics are good as long as you don&#8217;t look too closely.  It&#8217;s far below eighth generation standards, but they don&#8217;t look bad.  On PS4 they&#8217;re in full 1080p while the frame rate ranges between around 30 to 60 fps, staying closer to 60 most of the time.  Not bad at all.  The textures have a slight cel-shaded look which actually doesn&#8217;t look bad.  A complete playthrough for me, doing every sidequest I could find, took me about 17 hours, so the game doesn&#8217;t overstay its welcome.In the end, I have to say I enjoyed this game way more than I expected to.  If you&#8217;re expecting the next Dragon Age, you&#8217;ll be sorely disappointed, but for a small game from a small studio, the game actually exceeds expectations.  I had a blast with it and am now interested in seeing what Spiders does next.']\n",

No.  Is it the worst?  No.  Like many reviews out there I will state the same, there are not a lot of PS4 games out there to choose from right now and this really fills the void.  I was expecting &#34;B Movie&#34; voice overs on this and it sort of fits the bill for the game.  The graphics can be pretty amazing and then it will turn into Badlands type for backdrop when in a building or in town.  I find this funny considering how dynamic the game can be.Was highly disappointed in the character development or lack of.

Remember the days where you did not need to &#34;innovate&#34; the genre to be considered a success?

Then thee reviews are as low as possible without being totally in the gutter. Which is funny when you consider how so many trashy games get 8's and 9's from the same companies.Bound by flame is merely good. I won't go anywhere and try to call it a great game, but it gets far more right than it does wrong. You can clearly see influence of the Witcher series, dragon age, and dark souls. These are all good acts to be influenced by and so far I have not seen anything it really botches.  There are some weak points. The voice acting is certainly more like early game VA work. But they get the job done. Graphically I found it smooth and detailed, though the in conversation animations were a bit goofy at times.Character customization is present, but fairly weak. You won't be seeing much variety of looks, but you do have options.All in all anyone who is a fan of action RPG's should give it a look.My honest rating would be a 3.5 or so, but I will round it up to four.\"]\n",

Nothing on here will make you want to show off the game to others...it is not a pretty game, it doesn't make you go &#34;ooh&#34; or &#34;ahh&#34; so I would recommend to go the cheaper route and get it for the PS3 unless you just want to add something to your empty PS4 library like me.The story is pretty cool but the characters back stories  and personalities are not that entirely interesting and I found myself sticking to one companion (a NPC who fights alongside you) because she was the only that healed me consistently throughout the game. The game is one of those RPG's that allow for your choices to affect the story but I was deeply disappointed in just how linear or how little  your choices actually effected the narrative. If you are thinking that this game is as deep as Mass Effect, KOTOR, or even as diverse as the underrated Alpha Protocol...you will be sadly disappointed and it will negatively effect your desire to replay the game. There is a lot of instances where a character will ask you to choose only to find out that no matter what you choose the outcome will sadly be the same just maybe a sentence or two different.------------For example:Main character: &#34;You will die!&#34;Villain: &#34;Spare me, spare me&#34;-Your choices. Kill him or Spare him-1. Outcome if you Kill him: Main character taunts him and then kills the villain.2. Outcome if you spare the villain: The villain tries to attack you and you kill him.Either way, he dies and nobody in the story cares how nor does it effect anything thereafter.---------------------------So it was quite a bit of a bummer to find out that 90% of your choices lead to the same immediate outcome.The fighting mechanics are easy enough if you are fighting one-on-one but you have to rely on setting traps and luring enemies to get hurt or die. You really can't just go in and start hacking and slashing away at the enemies which is a good thing. On the default difficulty I made the mistake thinking this game was a typical modern action rpg where very little planning and careful timing is required. This game is a lot like Demon Souls and Witcher 2. A nice blend of the two. To be honest, I did have fun playing this game and I was thoroughly engaged the whole time while playing this budget title and I do see myself playing this again real soon. I do have to warn you about the hard final boss in this game. Cheap. Very cheap. Just save a ton of traps and either shoot him with arrows or keep blasting him with fire as you lure him into your deathtraps. I made a serious mistake in not coming into the fight well-equipped with traps. Major mistake. It is a serious, serious pain in the butt and tedious to attack him head on. Trust me when I say --- traps are your best friend in this game.I did not find the voice acting to be terrible like others claim. Sure it's not the best by any means but I've heard worst and I was never cringing but of course I've heard that the main female voice actor is thee worst voice ever but I only played as a male and he was pretty good.This is indeed budget title but I had fun playing it and as far as I can there are three different endings depending on your final choice in the game.\"]\n",

Solid gameplay and definitely entertaining combat system and story.Whoever mentioned voice acting is bad, I can just say it might not be the greatest but it definitely does the job and won't distract you from enjoying the experience.For anybody still hesitating, I can only say that for the time being this is the best RPG for ps4 out there.\"]\n",
            " [\"Bound by Flame has taken me by surprise. It's by a developer I've never heard of (Spiders) using their own game engine, and despite a little pre-release positivity from previews (which I had to seek out -- as far as I know, there hasn't been any marketing for this game and little buzz at all in the gaming media) my expectations weren't high.The game is slightly reminiscent of Fable (although very little), a bit more like Dragon Age, and quite a bit more like The Witcher 2. If those games are up your alley -- especially the latter two -- it's a safe bet that you'll enjoy Bound by Flame. The game features companions to help in combat (one at a time, although the lack of customization and leveling for the companions is disappointing -- they're just there to help). There is a simple crafting system, weapon upgrades, plenty of loot, skills, and perks to unlock. The game features good enemy and NPC design, high production value, and more. The graphics have a thin black outline, which you kind of forget about after a short while, making it a little bit like Borderlands graphics (but far less cartoonish).The music has been kind of... meh. It's not distracting, but it's not inspiring or epic. The voicing acting is good. If you've played games where it sounds like the voices were provided by the development team themselves, this isn't like that. They're not just flatly reading their lines. The problem -- if it even is one -- is more with the writing. Granted, this makes is very memorable and unexpected, but at times the NPC's (and even Vulcan, the main character) say things that are just kind of dumb. Not often, but enough. I haven't played as the female character (yeah, that's an option), but presumably it'd be the same.It doesn't feel at all like a hastily cobbled-together cash-in for the PS4's first-year ramp-up. It's a worthy, fun, detailed RPG that's well worth playing. They were smart to have it ready now, though. It's not competing for attention in the first weeks of the PS4's launch, yet it comes at a time when new retail games for the PS4 are only trickling in, and most importantly, several months before the next incarnations of Dragon Age and The Witcher 2 -- games that clearly influenced Bound by Flame -- are due to hit the market. (Note: It's available for PS3, 360, and PC also, but I can't comment on those versions.)I'd rather give the game a 4.5, but it isn't an option. In summary, if you like games like Dragon Age and The Witcher 2, and you're in the mood for a well-done RPG, give it a try.\"]\n",

If you have played quality RPG games such as Skyrim as I have, there is a high probability that you will have difficulty enjoying this game. I will explain my reasons below.ProsThis game does a few things well but these tend to be the norm these days. Visual design is solid and the atmosphere looks clean. Character model looks fine but nothing extraordinary.ConsThis game fell apart as I discovered many flaws in the basic mechanics of the game.1 - Difficulty level is artificially high. Even on the easiest setting, there are little loot to find in terms of ammo and health, which makes it very difficult to survive combats even in the beginning levels. Enemies gang up on you, which is fine, but you are unable to defend yourself due to lack of health potions. I consistently died and had no other option but to run away and wait for my health to regenerate.2 - Voice acting is REALLY REALLY bad. These actors sound like they just started acting. There is no conviction or passion in their voices, which combined with poorly-animated facial models, makes the cutscenes nearly unbearable to watch.3 - Combat is very sluggish. The response rate of control inputs seems laggy most times, and it takes several hits to take down enemies.4 - Enemies are dull and just lame in some cases. Strolling through the swamp, I was attacked by a tree and nearly died. Seriously??? A tree? Is this really worthy of putting into an action/RPG game???5 - Menu system and map navigation is confusing. I had a very hard time following the map to my next objective because the map does NOT rotate so even if you are walking to the left of the area, on the map it could show you walking to the right side of the map. It's hard to explain this but if you play the game you will know what I mean.6 - Upgrade system is flawed and useless. You gain XP by completing missions and defeating enemies, which earns you skill points that you can spend on the skill tree or passive skills. However, these don't seem to make a difference in your performance; I could not tell any difference at all even after leveling up to 7.Overall, there are just too many little flaws and quirks for me to enjoy this game. In short, this is a horrible game; one of the worst I have played. I absolutely CANNOT recommend this game at all. Rent or borrow if you like but DEFINITELY DO NOT BUY!\"]\n",

I gave it three stars because it was the first game created by these developers and hopefully not the last... maybe a part two will be better.\"]\n",
            " ['I will be honest, the only reason I gave this a chance is because how few titles of this genre are available on the PS4 right now . The game is fun IF you are patient and willing to overlook many really bad design choices. My biggest complaint with the gameplay is that it feels too repetitive and unfair..you don\\'t have that many skills to use or ways to kill your enemies especially at the beginning and you end up repeating the same noob-ish strategy/exploits over and over ...this especially true against boss battles. The game also loves to overwhelm you with multiple enemies ..long ranged enemies like archers and mages and then some incoming melee enemies ..while you do have a companions to help you, it still feel unfair because of how limited your options are. What I do like about the game? well I am a sucker for dark-fantasy settings, like dark souls or dragon\\'s dogma or game of thrones sort of thing and this game does have that going for it. The story isn\\'t much ..humanity on the verge of extinction, with only few mercenaries standing between the horde of demonic army and us. The visuals are solid, some pretty cel-shading but the character models and animation are poor. Voice acting was clearly not a priority for the developers, let\\'s just say it\\'s bad.Overall I can not recommend this game, the developers were obviously inspired by games like Dark Souls and Dragon Age however the game is a far cry from the aforementioned titles in term of quality. This isn\\'t surprising either, if you look at the history of this studio they have released two poor games prior to this one, \"Of Orcs and Men\" , and \"Mars: Log Wars\", you would think they have gotten better by now but that is not the case. This game feels like it was rushed to the market to capitalize on the fact that few games are out right now and it is getting much more spotlight that it would have done if there was any competition.']\n",

You end up fighting like 5 enemies at the same time, but all you go to do is attack then block immediately after.

I can converse somewhat with other characters...and it digs deep into some characters....but to what end?  it doesn't mean anything. you can go through the questions on what do they think of so and so...or why did they do this or that...  but its just something to do...doesn't go anywhere because people come and go so fast. You could leave camp and come back to find characters gone.....where did they go... lost in battle. What battle?  Oh the one you missed while on a mission..and which they blame you for not being there.  Honestly, with the PS4 being new, myself as well as others have been buying anything remotely looking good and we end up with some bad ones.\"]\n",
            " ['There aren\\'t many meaty adventure games for the PS4 so it\\'s nice that Bound by Flame fills the void. I typically enjoy lower budget RPG games, and seeing how I needed another PS4 game, I had to pick up Bound by Flame. Now, while I enjoy this style of game, I didn\\'t love this developer\\'s previous games, so I was a bit skeptical about how this one would turn out. Well, I\\'m glad to say that I love it. With that said, Bound by Flame isn\\'t perfect, but none of the flaws hamper my enjoyment of it.Firstly, I\\'ll cover the graphics. Due to it being developed on a lower budget and not a \"AAA\" game release, my expectations for the graphics were rather low, but I find this game to be beautiful. The characters don\\'t necessarily look real or animate as if they were real, however many of the textures are actually pretty detailed on PS4. It also runs in 1080p on PS4 with a framerate that was said to fluctuate between 30 and 60, but I\\'ve definitely had it drop lower than that. But I really like the art direction, lighting, shadows, etc. For a game that wasn\\'t created on a huge budget, Bound by Flame exceeded my expectations.Secondly, the gameplay is very fun. While not complex or that deep, what\\'s here is quite enjoyable. I especially like a lot of the combat animations; combat maneuvers look more fluid than I was expecting. Even though the gameplay isn\\'t complex, this is an incredibly challenging game that\\'ll challenge most players even on lower difficulty settings.Thirdly, I\\'ll mention exploration since it\\'s a role-playing game. I feel like I must mention that this isn\\'t a massive open world like Skyrim, it\\'s a far more structured RPG like The Witcher II. If I could compare Bound by Flame to any other RPG, it\\'d actually be The Witcher II. There\\'s a lot to see and do, but it\\'s not a game where you\\'ll get lost because of how enormous it is.Lastly, I\\'ll talk story and characters. The story isn\\'t super original and thus won\\'t blow you away, but I did enjoy my time with it. If you\\'re expecting something on par with some other role-playing games, this may disappoint you, but I found the story to be better than Skyrim which didn\\'t have a memorable narrative, in my opinion. As for characters, some are good and some are not. There\\'s a weird mishmash of solid voice acting and then some that\\'s hilariously bad. It\\'s not Two Worlds bad even at its absolute worst, but it\\'s by no means great at times. But even when the voice acting isn\\'t great, it\\'s pretty entertaining. FYI, the male character is voiced by Travis Touchdown himself, and that makes some of the cheesy lines absolutely amazing.As I end this review, I\\'ll just say that Bound by Flame is Spiders best game to date and my favorite PS4 game, but that shouldn\\'t be a surprise since I love the genre. Seeing how it\\'s slim pickens on these new consoles for the grand adventures that only RPGs offer, beggars can\\'t be choosers. And even then, Bound by Flame is a really good game. That\\'s my two cents.']\n",
            " [\"I have played several JRPGs throughout my years of gaming, many of which I struggled to stick with because I have a hard time focusing on a game where the plot is generic, the characters are stereotypical cookie cutter protagonists, and the dialog is just bad. I also tend to try and play as close to the authentic experience as I can and will usually opt for Japanese voices with English subtitles if I have the ability. Fortunately, I had none of those problems with Drakengard 3. Also, unlike most prequel/sequels, I was not burdened with needing to play the previous games although I already have, as the story does not rely on it and can stand on its own just fine.Gameplay/Controls: 4/5The controls for this game feel natural and the combos are easy to pull off. It's a straightforward hack and slash with elements of aerial combat while mounted on the dragon Mikhail. I do believe that the dragon controls could have been a bit better done, but it's not enough to warrant serious complaint. My biggest gripe in this department is the bad load times and lag. The game takes roughly half an hour to install, and you still have to sit through long and obnoxious loading screens. Though the combat system is fast-paced, you'll find yourself struggling to keep up with the twitchy lag you'll experience while zipping back and forth between enemies. From what I understand a patch is in the works that will fix some of the technical issues, so for now I'll give this section a 4/5.Graphics: 4/5I definitely agree with other reviewers' assessment that the ingame graphics are not exactly current-gen. I could easily see this game being played on the PS2 with slightly downscaled graphics if not for the beautifully rendered cutscenes. The cutscenes and  costume design aesthetics are really what makes Drakengard 3 shine. There is a very obvious theme of death in the classic high-contrast red on white colour scheme. The game is very dark and gory, and you can expect to see severed limbs and a boatload of blood splattering all over the place during combat and cutscenes alike. This is certainly not a game for the kids.Music/Voice acting: 5/5The music was part of what drew me into buying this game. Many of them contain Japanese lyrics and are very melodic. Beware! If you've worked a long day, the soundtrack can probably lull you to sleep. I was a little bit disappointed at my inability to switch to subtitled Japanese dialog since I was not fortunate enough to grab the collector's edition, but the English dubbing is actually quite well done. There is a lot of tension-breaking humour between characters throughout the levels. Expect to hear a lot of innuendos and harsh language. it is also important to note that you are not playing these role of your typical world saving heroine. You are playing a psycho who is bent on destroying the world and everyone in it. The overall theme of this game is intended for mature audiences.Overall: 4/5With the current flaws, this game can probably barely eke out with a 4. If they do patch the technical issues, I would definitely rate it a solid 4, if not a 4.5.\"]\n",
            " [\"...And I love it for that. After playing the first Drakengard, I eagerly awaited this one, because it looked so much more polished and, most importantly, fun. The first game was tedious, monotonous, and randomly difficult. This game fixes the first two, but not the last. Read on...When you play the game, the story is split into chapters. Each chapter is split into verses, and each verse is split into parts, such as cutscenes and levels. This makes it easy to go back to any part you want, which is a standard in the series. In addition, you will unlock mini-quests as you progress through the story. More on these later.The story is absolutely brilliant, and the best part of the game. Every character is well-written and weird. So weird. The main character, Zero, is best described as barbaric. She's completely uninhibited, rude, vulgar, powerful and loves to kill things. Her dragon partner, Michael is killed while protecting her at the beginning, and is resurrected as a baby dragon, Mikhail, who is the exact opposite as Zero: pacifistic, playful, cheery and not very bright. Zero is on a personal mission to kill her sisters. Her exact reasons aren't known to the player most of the game, so it would seem that she's a terrible person at first, which may be kind of off-putting to some people who may want to play this. However, despite the game's sick, serious and twisted nature at heart, it does not take itself seriously. At all. The game is absolutely hilarious because of the personalities of each character, especially the four disciples (Dito is my favorite). Each character will banter with each other throughout each levelGameplay is a mixed bag, depending on what part you're doing. For the most part, D3 is tons of fun. Ground missions in story mode are no longer tedious, boring slaying of armies who barely move. Instead, enemies actually fight back, and if you're not quick enough, you will get slayed. Zero can use four different weapons, swords, spears, bracers and chakrams. Each has their own specific use: swords are all-around balanced, spears are for penetrating defensive enemies, bracers are for racking up combos, and chakrams are ranged. You will usually find yourself fighting small groups of enemies at a time, or one to three large boss enemies. The boss enemies are very well made. When you first meet one, it's pretty difficult, and you may need to retry several times, but once you figure out their movements and are used to the controls, you will be able to figure out ways of defeating them without taking a single hit. Ground fights are fast-paced and fighting is more complex than typical beat-em'-ups, but once you get used to the controls, they are incredibly satisfying. However, the game's camera is pretty bad, but not nearly as bad as Drakengard 1. There's an option to make the camera follow Zero from behind, but in all honesty, it doesn't work correctly at all. The levels themselves are pretty linear, with three treasures hidden throughout.Missions with Mikhail are either on-rail shooting/flying levels, or ground/aerial battles. The flying levels are, with the exception of one boss, pretty easy and forgettable. If you've played Drakengard before, you know what to expect with these.The ground/aerial battles are a lot more fun, but the controls are a bit funky. Mikhail jumps/flies with X, and he can shoot fireballs or dive bomb the enemy in the air. On the ground, he can shoot fireballs and unleash a sweeping flame breath, which is devastating against enemy soldier hordes. Most of these levels are pathetically easy once you get the hang of the controls, which is kind of a letdown since most of them are very key boss fights, but they are still satisfying because of how action-packed they are.Then there's Accord's requests, and this is where the game is ridiculously and randomly difficult. You unlock these as you play through the story, and they involve collecting items from enemies or treasure chests they are guarding in a time limit. Collecting the items from enemies is pretty fun most of the time, and the later missions become extremely chaotic to the point where it's difficult to tell what's even happening on-screen. The treasure chest levels on the other hand are incredibly aggravating, because in most of them, you are forced to use a weapon of a certain type only. The chests require many hits to open, and some weapons, especially early-game spears and chakrams, are horribly slow. In order to beat these levels, near perfect timing and even good luck is a necessity (because enemies will knock you away otherwise), making them unreasonably difficult and frustrating. To make things worse, when you lose, you have to wait for the game to re-load the whole stage each time. You will also unlock survival mini-games, which are pretty self-explanatory and difficult, but in a way that's actually fair to the player. If you lose, it's usually your own fault here.Like other Drakengard games, this one has multiple endings and secret levels to unlock. I won't spoil anything, but I felt like this was portrayed in a strange way, and some of it didn't make much sense to me.The music and voice-acting are superb, and keep the experience engaging. The same group that composed for Nier also worked on this one, so you may know what you're getting into if you've heard that one. This game's music is more bombastic and energetic compared to Nier, making it unique.The game does suffer from framerate issues. When lots of enemies are on screen, or a lot of explosions or magic bloom effects are going on, it will dip as low as 10-15 FPS, which is VERY low, and it may render some controls unresponsive for a brief period. The game's graphics are not nearly as detailed as other PS3 games either, which is pretty disappointing considering these issues. I've read that this can be fixed by setting your PS3 to 480p (low resolution mode), but it looks blurry on a HDTV. Using a 1:1 pixel-compatible screen allegedly makes it look better if you do this.Music from Drakengard 1 and Nier are available as downloadable content, and you can switch to these themes for battles, which is a welcome add-on. There are also cosmetic upgrades for Zero and Mikhail that give small bonuses. Future DLC will come out later, unless you ordered the limited edition from Square-Enix, which includes all of it (I think).Overall, this is a very fun and entertaining game with a few technical issues, which is a little disappointing this far into the PS3's life cycle. Despite that, they aren't bad enough to render the game unplayable, and if you enjoy chaotic gameplay, twisted humor and an engaging mythos, you will love this game like I did.\"]\n",
            " ['It was very difficult for me to give this game 4/5 stars because I do enjoy it. The game has decent game play, but it lags a lot. I have this game installed onto my actual console and it suffers from a lot of lag. If you can ignore the technical issues of the game, then I would recommend to rent it first.Game play is a basic hack & slash RPG. You have the options to upgrade and buy new weapons of a huge variety. There are several side-quests you can undertake to level up your character or do so just for the rewards. (Must progress through the chapters to unlock side-quests). The way levels are lined out are a short, tiny map where you can find up to 3 treasures in each verse of a Chapter.You can go back and redo chapters to build exp, get extra materials, and even gold.Boss fights are quite tedious. The \"Intoner Mode\" makes boss fights hardly a challenge.The game features a wonderful OST composed by the same artist which work with Nier. I found the soundtrack to be really nice, and helps make up for the game\\'s quality.Story of this video game is where it shines most. If you want an overall decent game with a decent story, this one is it. Again, I want to stress the fact that this is overall a decent RPG. It suffers from large amounts of lag, but this game still stands as a decent game. I wouldn\\'t recommend paying full price for this game, would consider it a rental or buy at $19.99. The current price is not worth what you get for. Again, I would say rent first.']\n",
            " [\"Reviewing this game is challenging given that it is both refreshing and disappointing in so many ways. To start off, the game boasts one of the more creative casts of characters I've seen in an RPG/Action game. The main character Zero is very endearing in her own antagonistic way. The crude humor abounds this game, dick jokes are everywhere. If you are easily offended by almost frat-like sexual conversations and innuendos then you should turn away right now because this game has them in spades. With that said, if you are part of the limited audience who will enjoy this kind of humor, then you are in luck! Drakengard 3 will be a riot for you. When it comes to my opinion on the humor, I felt that at first it was a really nice way to introduce me into the world of Drakengard; after the 20 hour mark or so the humor became stale and overplayed. However, the dialogue remained one of the best aspects of this game up until the end. To be frank, once you drop about 20 hours into the game you start to realize just how little outside of creative dialogue this game really has to offer. It's really quite an anemic experience when you start to compare it to other games in it's genre such as God of War, Bayonetta, and Devil May Cry. Sure, Drakengard 3 maybe much longer than those games, but it provides so little substance that the game feels like it's all quantity with little quality. Like filling up on junk food, it may fill you up, but it will give you nothing of sustenance. Overall Drakengard 3 is a &#34;fair&#34; game that gets combat, humor, and dialogue right most of the time, while miserably failing to provide innovative game play or even an acceptable aesthetic experience.Graphics:The graphics are some of the worst I have seen on playstation 3. I have seen 2007 games with more detail, sharper textures, and less jagged edges than this game. It is really quite sad when the latest HD remake of certain PS2 games look sharper and with more detail / draw distance than this game. By far the graphics department is the game's lowest point. 3/10Audio:Fantastic music! If you enjoyed the music of the previous Drakengard titles or Nier you will enjoy this game's musical score. By far one of the better and stronger aspects of this game.  9/10Gameplay:Overall, the gameplay is solid. The combat is rewarding and feels like a solid hack & slash game. There are ways to build combos by switching between weapons on the fly. A wide array of weapons keeps the combat feeling fresh well into the 20 hour mark. Combat is moderately challenging without becoming overwhelming. There are RPG elements sprinkled in as well such as buying new weapons and upgrading them as well, but the meat and potatoes is really the hack & slash combat style. What holds Drakengard back is the unacceptable frame rate dips. At times you will be fighting 10-20 enemies on the screen at once and will be prompted to call forth your dragon to assist. When you do so, the frame rate can and will dip down to the single digits. It is absolutely unacceptable for a game with such poor visuals to dip bellow 30 fps at any point. Lazy development is the only way this can be explained. 7/10Replay value:If you want a game that you can play for a long time look no further than Drakengard 3. There is a lot of replay value with tons of side missions, a 35-45 hour long main story, and even multiple endings. In fact, if you want to see everything this game has to offer you will likely have to play it more than once to view all the different possible endings. There is more than enough contatn here to keep almost any fan of action games busy for a very long time. 8/10Value:Is this game worth the $50 asking price? That all depends on what you want out of it. If you want to laugh at some crude humor and hilarious dialogue between characters, then this game is a good choice for you. If you want a simplistic albeit functional hack & slash game that you can play for a long time, this game is for you. However, if you were looking for a deep, rewarding, immersive, and story driven experience, you should look elsewhere. The developers and mainly Square Enix were smart when they priced this game at $49.99, as it is clearly not worth the full retail $60 price tag of other games in it's genre. With that said, even the $50 price point is a bit stiff for what you get here. I would recommend waiting until the game drops to $40 or $30 before picking it up.Overall: If I could rate this game outside of the star system I would give it a 6/10. It is a solid game with creative dialogue and unique characters that falls flat on the visual & frame rate departments. While graphics do not make or break a game, graphics do have a significant effect on the overall experience. Especially when your PS3 game looks like it could have been developed for the original Wii system.\"]\n",

            " ['Hugely disappointing follow-up to NIER. It\\'s a typical Dynasty Warriors-style \"musou\" hack and slash with some highly questionable fighting mechanics, unresponsive controls, poor enemy design, PlayStation 2-quality graphics, and a framerate that hopelessly sputters and chugs on a constant basis. It doesn\\'t even have the non-linearity of Dynasty Warriors; you\\'re almost always moving in a straight line. There are tacked-on segments where you get to fly your dragon, but these are nowhere near as playable or enjoyable as similar sequences in Drakengard 2. NIER was never the pinnacle of its genre on a mechanical level, but it played well and fights felt crunchy and satisfying, especially with Weiss\\' powers. (To really appreciate the design of NIER\\'s combat, try the DLC content.) Drakengard 3 is a dog of an action game that wouldn\\'t have been acceptable even in 2001, when Devil May Cry was released.The story and characters are somewhat more remarkable than the gameplay, but they\\'re nowhere near as thought-provoking or endearing as in NIER. There is no one in this game like Kaine or Emil who you continue to care about long after the credits roll. Zero feels like a female version of Kratos from God of War, and her character is just as overblown and uninteresting. It\\'s standard anime melodrama, rather than something truly unique and affecting, which NIER was. There is an emphasis on sexual innuendo that lacks any tact or subtlety. Drakengard 1 had a strong subtext of dark sexuality expressed through several of its characters (which was partially censored out of the US release), but it never felt like something thrown in for its own sake to make the game more \"edgy.\" That\\'s not the case here.The best thing to come out of this game by far is the soundtrack. Go find yourself a copy and ignore the game, unless you\\'re an absolute diehard who can\\'t ignore a new title set in the NIER/Drakengard universe. I am confident that Drakengard 3 would have been handled properly had Cavia remained in business, though it was sadly not to be. People in certain circles will still be talking about NIER ten years from now, but this misfire is destined to be rightfully forgotten.']\n",

Combat is fast-paced and dynamic, with a good variety of weapons that all have different movesets. The game starts out extremely easy, but about halfway through it ramps up and by the end it's a good challenge. There's lots of optional levels and many weapons to collect, so you can keep busy for a while in this game. I feel like I got my money's worth.Minor spoiler warning: The last level is notoriously difficult, and utilizes gameplay mechanics completely different from the rest of the game. Many players have ragequit without ever finishing.\"]\n",
            " [\"Square enix really let me down here. I mean I don't know if they intended to actually make this series popular or make a quick buck. But it was obvious that this game was a HUGE LET DOWN. Lets break this break this review into sections as to why i think this deserves a 3 star or lower.Graphics: Some of you may not mind the graphics as long as the gameplay is good and the story is good right? Wrong. No matter how much comical and bad ass content they put into this game, the graphics were horrifying. It looked like i was playing final fantasy 10 on the ps2, or starfox on the gamecube. The graphics engine was made by Unreal, if that doesn't scream low budget game then nothing will.Gameplay: The controlling in this game was very poor. As much as I liked slashing enemies and going berserk into a fray of enemies. The character controlling is very difficult to handle, not in a good way but a bad way. Its kind of hard to explain in words without spoiling some of the in-game content, but Im sure everyone has played a game where character handling is difficult, not in a fun or challenging way, just straight up annoying. If anyone decides to get it, you will see what i mean.Plot: aside from the comical scenes, which was a huge change in Japanese rpg. I personally thought the story was stupid and old. The characters in the game are cliche. I can probably say that you have seen this story setting in 95% of the Japanese RPG games.Reasons why I gave it a 3 star: Other than all the bad things i mentioned about the game. I actually enjoyed some parts of the game as well. I enjoyed some of the character designs, especially the main character. Some of the action in the game was very amusing to me, again SOME. I also did enjoy a majority of the music played in this game. This game can pass the time.Final verdict: This game is definitely NOT WORTH the $50, I wouldn't even pay $30 if I knew what was in store for me. I really really wanted this game to be amazing, I wish square enix spent just a little more time, money, and effort in making this game. I see a lot of potential, but unfortunately this was the outcome. This game is pretty much a low budget version of god of war 3, square enixified (lol).\"]\n",

I say that cause thats the only problem with Drakengard 3 in my opinion. The story is good, gameplay is also good, graphics get the job done, but like i said before i love Zero and the cast. Id say this game reminds me of Soul Sacrifice but with better story. I know its not really a review more of a first impression but im 6 hours in and if you can get past the bad framerate and like hack and slash/jrpgs then by no means go ahead and buy this.']\n",
            " [\"While I never had a chance to play the first two Drakengard games I was very interested to play Drakengard 3 due to my love of Nier.  Access Games created Drakengard 3 which is partially built from ex-Cavia staff which was over Nier.  While Drakengard 3 and Nier are completely different games beyond each having a phenomenal soundtrack that have similarities I still enjoyed Drakengard 3 for what it was.Story:A brief synopsis of the game: 5 sisters descend upon a war ravaged land to bring peace through the use of their mystical song magic. After the war stops each sister becomes ruler of a specific region of the world. Sometime later the sixth sister, Zero, decides to kill her 5 sisters with the help of her dragon, Mikhail.The story in Drakengard 3 is fairly dark and somewhat twisted but never feels so due to the humor that is in the game.  The constant banter between Zero and Mikhail adds some light to the game.  The disciples that Zero recruits along her journey add a bit of humor to the game as albeit in a sexual way.  The game throws you in without explaining much in terms of back story for any of the characters which adds confusion to the game's story but pushed me forward to complete the game to see what happens.I was disappointed with the lack of character information in the game though since the game never gives that much of a back story to any of the characters.  There are short novella's that provide some interesting back story to the characters on the game's website and there is planned character downloadable content that will be released but it would have been nice to have had that already in the game to have it feel more complete.Music:I was really drawn into wanting this game mostly due to Keiichi Okab composing the soundtrack to the game. Keiichi was the same composer who was over Nier and that has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. The music in Drakengard 3 was one of the highlights to the game and was really great.Game play:Battles are very hack and slash in the game and could be compared somewhat to the Dynasty Warriors series. Attacking is done with a light attack and then a heavy attack which requires stamina to use. You can block attacks which saps stamina when hit and can parry an attack if a block is timed correctly against an incoming attack. There is a dash function as well to help evade attacks. You start off with just a sword but as you progress through the game will have access to spears, bracers, and chakrams. Certain enemies will need to be taken down with certain types of weapons (shielded enemies need to be charged with a spear, enemies on unreachable ledges will need to be attacked with a chakram, etc) but weapons can be changed mid battle which is a fairly smooth process. Battles are fairly quick and fun but character movement isn't very smooth which can make getting hit a little too easily if you fighting a large group of enemies.The game does split up the monotony of fighting hordes of enemies by offering air battles where you fight on Mikhail's back which are fun beyond being a little frustrating at times.The game is an action RPG so you will earn experience at the end of each quest along with gold which can be used to buy new weapons, upgrade your current weapons, and buy items.Instead of the game being more of an open world game it's broken up into chapters which will each take place in a new area. This is good if you only want to play a bit of the game at a time but it detracts from the game for me since the world doesn't feel complete. There isn't really any sense of exploration in the game beyond trying to find the few treasure chests hidden in each chapter.Graphics:Graphics are definitely Drakengard 3's biggest downfall as the game is somewhat a mess. The game looks like a very early PS3 game and there is a lot of screen tearing. The story characters have good design and all look unique and interesting. The set pieces aren't all that interesting though which can make the game feel bland.Overall Drakengard 3 was a very fun game to play but it is held back by its graphics and the lack of explanation of it's story.  I'd really rate the game a 3.5 but since Amazon doesn't allow half stars it had to be bumped to a 4.\"]\n",

I liked collecting and upgrading the weapons.The graphics were poor.  The camera controls were not sharp.  The stage designs were very linear.  The game play is fun for a bit, but the weapon swapping system isn't really deep or rewarding enough to carry all the way to the end.  Most of the characters were one-dimensional; they attempted to make them interesting only by extrapolating their niche into the absurd.  The variety of monsters were not interesting.  The post-apocalyptic world only holds your interest for the briefest periods of time.  The humor occasionally amuses, but it feels desperate and forced at other times.There is a pretty long list of other games that I would recommend ahead of this one.  The Souls series, Dragon's Dogma, Dragon's Crown, Nier... even Reckoning: Kingdoms of Amalur or Dynasty Warriors 8.\"]\n",

From the soundtrack, to the over-the-top voice acting, to the fast hack & slash combat, etc., Drakengard 3 delivers a unique experience while still being similar to other hack & slash titles. I was mostly anticipating Drakengard 3 because it was created by ex-Cavia talent who worked on the prior games and also Access Games who worked on the cult classics Spy Fiction and Deadly Premonition. That said, Drakengard 3 has more depth than most games in the genre, but it\\'s held back by some issues pertaining to the Unreal Engine 3.You play as Zero, a girl with quite an attitude, which makes the story fun and enjoyable to experience. While I don\\'t find the story to be particularly original, the way its delivered, in addition to the entertaining voice acting and dialogue, help it become greater than the sum of its partsAs for the gameplay, you have the main objective, but you also have many side quests to complete. The gameplay itself has two parts: hack & slash combat and dragon combat, both offering some variety and a nice change of pace from one another. While neither of the two offer \"best in class\" gameplay, it\\'s very enjoyable nonetheless.Even though this game has problems, I still really like its presentation. Cutscenes looked really good, in my opinion, and the soundtrack is excellent throughout.Since I mentioned that this game has some issues, let me mention those quickly. This game runs on the Unreal Engine 3, I think (or some other iteration of Unreal), and I think the developers had issues with the engine. While the game can look good at times, especially during cutscenes, textures and whatnot look decidedly dated for a PS3 title. In addition to the dated textures, there\\'s a lot of framerate slowdown and screen tear throughout the game, which is unfortunate.Other than the technical shortcomings, I really enjoyed my time with Drakengard 3.']\n",

Given your typical 5 year old isn't Hercules, and I've seen him handle a dozen different controllers, tablets, and phones and their cables without reducing them to scrap, I find it hard to believe that this would not have otherwise quickly failed under even normal usage.

I kind of doubt the recommended two hours is going to be enough, particularly since different chargers put out different amperage).  I suspect undercharging it that would lead to battery problems, similar to the ones discussed here.It is the same size as the Fire controllers, which is awesome for kids or women or people with small hands, but might be a bit on the small size for folks with larger hands.This is meant to be a generic controller for Android devices, which cuts both ways.  If you want a controller that can work on your Fire and your tablet, you're in luck.

It has a soft rubber feel which is more comfortable to hold, as opposed to the regular slick plastic of the Fire controller.The price is almost 1/2 of the Fire controller at this writing, so I'd definitely go with the less expensive one.In general, having a controller extends the usefulness of the Fire TV unit.

Nyko says the controller is HID compatible but it shows up as a keyboard on PC and Macs making it unusable as a game controller on those platforms. It would have been nice if the Playpad Pro could work as a standard bluetooth controller across all platforms.But that gripe aside, this is a device marketed at Android and Amazon Fire TV users and will work well on those platforms.\"]\n",

It's definitely functional as a game controller.  It sets up easy, for me at least.  Works fine. It's a little bit smaller and more rounded than the standard controller, which makes it a bit more comfortable. The rubber feel of the plastic is also nicer and it's lighter.  And it works fine in controlling games. Responsive and the buttons, pads, and sticks work fine. All that makes for a good alternative.However, it lacks the standard controller's Fire TV specific buttons, buttons that allow the controller to fully function as a remote for other Fire TV tasks (except for the voice control).  The PlayPad is, after all, a basic controller that isn't designed for the Fire TV specifically.This controller is rechargeable rather than having replaceable batteries, which sounds like a good idea, but I don't like it as much. The charge doesn't last as long, and it seems that the battery used internally allows the battery to discharge relatively quickly when not in use. So, whether you use this often or not, you'll be recharging it about the same amount of times.  Meanwhile, some eneloops or similar type rechargeable AA batteries for the regular controller have very, very little discharge when not in use and last a fair bit longer in general. So, it seems a cheaper quality battery is used here, and can't be replaced.That means that when you do want to play, this controller will take a bit more attention, requiring recharges more frequently.  It works as a controller fine, but doesn't add any other functionality. On the other hand, the cost is much less. I'd say this would make a good choice as a second (or more) controller, but I know I'm glad I have the Amazon controller as well.\"]\n",

Unpairing then repairing it corrected that.It's responsive enough to play action games like Sonic the Hedgehog, and since the configuration is similar to the Xbox 360, it's easy to learn to use.I do like it better than the Fire TV game controller for it's configuration and responsiveness, and my son agrees. But the Fire TV controller is more comfortable to hold on to, and you can replace the batteries instead of having to recharge the whole controller.

            " ['*UPDATE*I want to clarify my review a bit. Many gamers are going to look at this game as very similar to Animal Crossing, but this is not the case. This game relies on wacky interaction between the Miis, but you do not have direct control of any of the Miis like you do with your village avatar in Animal Crossing. More importantly, you won\\'t spend hundreds of hours in this game like you would in Animal Crossing collecting money to repay Tom Nook, or upgrade your town. Despite this, Tomodachi Life is a great game for casual gameplay.****ORIGINAL REVIEW****I got the early demo for this game and realized that I had to get this \"game\", which feels like it ought to be on iOS, or Android, or even Facebook, than the 3DS. As most reviewers have said, the game is a mix of Animal Crossing and The Sims, with really quirky humor. You are the proprietor of an island (which you get to name), and then you get to pick 30 Miis to invite to live on your island. You can get special Miis like Shaquille O\\'Neal (basketball player) or Christina Aguilera (singer) from the Nintendo\\'s Tomodachi website. You can also import Miis from your Mii Maker, or by using the QR reader; but for some reason you can get the Miis from your friend list. Next you have to customize things like their personality, and even the sound of their voice. Nintendo gives you alot of options in the voice alone: type of voice (old person, young child), the tone, the quality and even the accent. You don\\'t have to do this if you get the special Mii\\'s from the Tomodachi website.You don\\'t control any Mii directly, instead you interact with them by handling their various requests - getting them food when they are hungry, playing games like Concentration (the game where you have to match pairs of cards). Doing these gets you money which you can use to buy things to give them, like food or clothes, or even interior decorations. In addition to money you level up the Mii, and can give them gifts like a Treadmill or Wii U, or teach them a new catchphrase (curse words are banned, so this is good for kids).You can also watch the Miis interact with each other. When they have similar gifts they tend to hang out with each other (Eli Manning and Winnie the Pooh Bear like to hula dance... go figure).The major plus and also major negative of this game is that it does not require as much attention as Animal Crossing, where you have to invest many hours to customize the island.  Here you only have to worry about the Miis, which makes this game easier to play in 10 to 15 minute intervals. But this might not be good for hardcore players who do want to spend hours on end hunting bugs for money.Regardless, this is an enjoyable game with a quirky sense of humor for casual gamers and gamers on the go.']\n",
            " [\"I have to agree with other reviews - this isn't exactly a game in the traditional sense. It is a play space where you bring in Mii's and see how they interact and give them things to make them happy. Think of it as a very simplified Sims mixed with Animal Crossing. So if you are a fan of that type of simulation then this will be a hit with you.The best part of Tomodachi is creating Mii's from people you know, celebrities or even people from history and literature. You can become friends with these characters in this virtual island. You can also alter their personalities.If you are expecting a traditional game then this is not it. If you want a new experience on the 3DS/2DS then this is perfect. It is more about interactions than missions - there doesn't seem to be any collecting of fruit or bugs. You get money from doing things to make the Mii's happy.For parents - most of the text on the screen is also spoken so that should help those with reading difficulty. The one thing that I'd want to know as a parent is that this game incorporates food items. So far the food choices have been a lot of sugar items. Something to talk about with the kids so they understand that this is a game and not how a person should really eat.On the whole this is a great non-violent title for everyone. There are creative elements like picking out clothes and apartment decor and creating lyrics to songs. Creating Mii's is key to populating the island and it can be fun to create Mii's from people in your life.\"]\n",
            " [\"There are some things that I review where I simply can't describe why I like them. I just do. It may be a certain trait that just plays right into an interest of mine, or an original concept that I particularly jive on. But sometimes, even that's not the case. There's no fathomable reason why I should love this thing as much as I do, yet I go and sing its praises to anybody who will listen. And so, I can't really explain why I love &#34;Tomodachi Life&#34; as much as I do. But I suspect the ability to make anime icon Lupin III and Hillary Clinton get hitched, or have Hank Hill and Sadako of &#34;The Ring&#34; infamy be best buddies might have something to do with it.&#34;Tomodachi Life&#34; has absolutely no plot, and to an extent, absolutely no point whatsoever. You might think of it as &#34;The Sims,&#34; but played with Miis and done in the style of a particularly abstract Andy Kaufman gag. You either import Miis from your 3DS, create your own in-game, scan them in, or use a friend's, then put them on an island that you name. Oh, yes, that's after you customize their voice and personality. After that, you set them loose to interact with each other, solving their crises, aiding their relationships, and occasionally taking a peek into their dreams. Which sometimes involve them in humorous &#34;Sailor Moon&#34; fantasies. Or dancing and chanting in a very cult-like fashion around a miscellaneous household item. Yep.Honestly, there isn't much in the way of real, engaging gameplay, but to me, that's what makes it such a fresh experience. There are no convoluted menus. No annoying menial tasks that might take 20 minutes at a time to do. Nothing like that. &#34;Tomodachi Life&#34; is, to an extent, a life simulator for people who hate life simulators. Everything is handled with a few clicks of the touch screen, and you can either play for five minutes at a time or fifty minutes at a time. Yes, sometimes, things will repeat. A Mii will have the same dream, or a line of dialogue will be uttered twice. But having been played at a very dedicated rate for over two weeks now, I can wholeheartedly say that I am seeing new and unique things everyday still. To top it off, my partner has the game as well, and her experience has been almost entirely different from my own. To me, that speaks volumes to the quality of the game. No one copy will progress or act in the exact same way, which is more than I can say for Nintendo's other major life simulator, &#34;Animal Crossing,&#34; despite being a very big fan of that as well.But what do you do outside of creating Miis and paying attention to their needs? You'll definitely be shopping for them, whether it be hats, clothes, outlandish costumes, food, or new decorations for their rooms, which contribute to their RPG-like &#34;Happiness Level.&#34; Outside of that, you can check in on them in a restaurant, send them on an 8-bit role-playing quest, watch two lovebirds chase each other down the beach, or peek in on an outdoor barbecue party. My personal favorite side-activity, and one which can certainly become a time sink if you let it, is at the concert hall. Choosing from a nice variety of musical choices, you can make Miis sing as a solo act, a duo, or a group. Best part is? You get to write the lyrics to any song and hear them sing it. They can be silly, funny, or (if you work around the censored words list, which is pretty easy) a veritable cornucopia of nonsensical raunch. This is just one of the many activities in &#34;Tomodachi Life&#34; that may seem like a silly diversion, but can quite easily keep you engaged for far longer than it should.That's something that could be said for the entire experience, though. &#34;Tomodachi Life&#34; might not be the most in-depth, realistic life simulator out there, but I don't think it's trying to be. If &#34;The Sims&#34; is the most painstaking, and &#34;Animal Crossing&#34; the lighthearted equivalent, then this is the out-of-left-field, completely off-the-rails festival of unmitigated silliness that people who just want a good laugh play. It's fun by yourself, and it's fun playing side-by-side with a friend, trading Miis and watching them interact with each other's islanders. There's no huge commitment, and you can play it every day, or quit for a month then come back to it. Honestly, this is the type of life simulator I've been waiting for, and it's the type of bizarre, risky game that I've wanted to see Nintendo make more of. Abstract in its humor, novel in its execution, this is something that I can't help but love every second of.So, like I said above, at the beginning of this admittedly short review, &#34;Tomodachi Life&#34; is something that I can't necessarily put into words. Simply put, it's just fun, funny, and most importantly, fresh. There's nothing else on the market quite like this. Any person of any age, I think, could have a blast with this. While I do think it would be nice if same-sex relationships were included, and that the default &#34;player hand&#34; that shows up sometimes could have its race customized (because, y'know, not everyone has pale skin,) I still think this is, all-in-all, a very wonderful and unique experience that almost anybody could have a total blast with.I mean, c'mon. Where else are you going to watch Duke Nukem become the most desired man on an island? Or watch yourself get into a committed relationship with a dreadheaded goth? Or see Danny Trejo role around on the floor in a sweatsuit out of boredom? Yeah. I rest my case.Pros:- A unique idea executed well.- Loads of content, and most of it is fun.- One of the funniest games on the market.Cons:- Lack of same-sex relationships sucks for those aren't straight.- Occasional repetition.Grade: 9 (Bomber)\"]\n",

I find most people have that feature off though lol.  But anyways,  you start with this empty island,  you create your first me, usually yourself and they pop up in an apartment.  Each Mii gets their own apartment and as you nourish each Mii, and help encourage socializing with the other Mii's and buying the correct foods and clothes and things for each of the Mii's personalities, you get money and items to help keep feeding and clothing and what not your Mii population.  As the Mii population grows and you keep your Mii's happy, the town opens up one store after another, all the while you still have to feed, talk to, buy clothes, etc for each one, so as your island grows in population, your whole day is shot by having to socialize with all your Mii's haha.  So far, I only scratched the surface, but i'm sure the interactions with all the Mii's gets a little complicated later.  5 for now as it's been sort of entertaining so far.

            " [\"At first, I wasn't gonna buy this game; however, I saw the charm it had through it's demo, bought it off the Nintendo eShop, just to see how it works with the demo, and I haven't put it down.  It's just so odd, it becomes addicting just to see what happens next.  That's one area where it has it's charm: the weirdness of it.  These moments mostly come through the Miis' dreams, but you can make it weirder by making Miis based on pop culture, TV shows, which I got three characters from King of the Hill just for giggles, or just make weird Miis in general, which I also did by making an ugly woman with a beard.  Some of the items in game are also strange, like a photorealistic theme for an apartment.  Another area the game has charm is the interactions with the Miis.  The Miis are basically independent, though they be the most dependent things with junk like 'needing help sneezing,' and sometimes, Miis even fall in love, become friends, and even get married, which happens to be quite controversial for the game before release.  I've seen plenty of moments of the Miis just chilling, and I also had a dating Mii, which happened to be my Mii, have a fight with his girlfriend, which I had my niece's Mii try to calm them down (in possibly what is close to the first form of domestic violence in a video game ever).  You can even help Miis make other Miis friends (so many Miis in so little time), which can go either way.  Either they become friends or don't!  People call this a Sims or Animal Crossing styled game; however, I like to call this more of a god-like simulator game, but what could've helped this sequel to a Japanese classic (yes, this is a sequel.  Original game on DS.) was to be in Animal Crossing form.  While there was nothing wrong with the way the game is now, an Animal Crossing styled game would've made me feel more with the world, and I really thought it was what this game was.  Sometimes, you get Miis that have wants or needs, which you can do or not do with no consequences at all, that are impossible, like getting a banana split when the food store doesn't have it.  Not a big deal since you don't have to do these and not be punished for it, but like in real life, I do try to help the best I can.  I also don't get why the married Miis still have their apartments even though they have a house, I wouldn't keep my apartment if I had a nice house.  Most of the flaws I say might be looked upon as nitpicks, and really I think they are myself, but even those flaws doesn't stop this from being a good game to play.  At the moment, I don't think it's worth $35 dollars, plus tax whether digital or physical which doesn't make sense to me, because I just don't know how long I'll be playing this game.  I recommend this game, but if you're not rushing to get it, wait until the price goes down.  Overall, this game makes Parappa the Rappa look like reality, and in a way, it makes Tomodachi Life a better game for it.\"]\n",

It's great when you first play it and see the insanity your Miis are into, and it's very hilarious.I wish there were more things to do in this game and that it had more unique content as time went on. However, after you add a bunch of Miis and watch some people get married and have kids, you'll be pretty tired of how repetitive it gets.I would recommend this to people that don't have a lot of time to game and want to see their Miis do random things. The game is great, but I think this should be a download only at 10 bucks because there isn't much content at all. I'm not sure why there are so many positive reviews, I assume people haven't played it for a few hours just yet.

It mainly entails you looking after the Miis you upload/create and frequently making decisions for it, but you are really just an observer to their lives. A big chunk of the game is feeding, clothing, and playing many different games with the Miis. You can also sort of guide and approve/reject their relationships if they ever arise. The game has a good amount of charm that comes from the unique and slightly absurdest humor (through Mii dialogue, crazy dreams, and the games you play with them).The game is good but a big problem is that the bulk of the game (feeding/gift giving/games/etc.) can start to feel really tedious and/or boring after awhile. There seems to be a lot of content in the game which is great but the core gameplay seems like it would start to lose a lot of its novelty after a couple of weeks. I'd still recommend it if you're looking for a unique and quirky simulation game.\"]\n",
            " [\"The Her Interactive Nancy Drew brand appears to be driven by members of secret societies and elitists, with Illuminati themes running throughout the games. These games corrupt the morals of minors. Let's start with Bess' top. Do we really need to see the tops of her bosoms? How old is she? Why does HI insist on creating female characters in either bare midriffs or with their breasts popping out of their tops? We get it, HI is trying to be cool and &#34;with it,&#34; but fails to recognize that many of its gamers are young Christian girls who follow this brand to avoid such cultural pollution.Next we have the recurring theme of the Illuminati, which has taken the form in previous games of secret societies, rituals, withcraft, runes, astrology...In this game, we are following the developments of Sonny Joon, a character whose mischief has charmed us in many previous games. Sonny, we discover, believes he is Annunaki -- that is, crazy elites who believe they have the right to rule and oppress the little people by virtue of their special DNA, which includes breeding with aliens. This is all part of secret society nonsense and insider jokes/propaganda to indoctrinate the young in new world order symbolism and values....It doesn't hurt that these elites endorse promiscuity and that Joon's admirer is a boy crazy Bess whose breasts are popping out of her top, particularly in her still photo.Her Interactive is not promoting Christian values, but degenerate filth and trying to indoctrinate the young into the values of degenerate elites. Interestingly, Reality Shows are part of this design -- a la Hunger Games -- whereby elites, masters of the universe (in this case, Sonny Joon), pit hapless individuals to descend to the level of animals to tear each other to shreds and emerge the victor...Survival of the fittest through brute strength, absolution of values and ethics, and reducing man/woman to the level of beasts.Her interactive tries to capture a similar dynamic with this game -- with backstabbing contestants, a couple in which the woman is the strong conniver while the man has been reduced to grunting simpleton. George was nearly murdered ...or accidentally fell off a bridge that snapped?My problem with this game is  not that the themes are dark (some great mysteries delve into areas of love, sex, violence, murder, etc.), but Her Interactives have a more insidious agenda. Its gamers are wondering...where's the plot?  What was the mystery? What was the point?The point was that an entirely new generation of girls has just been introduced to Annunaki via a  freakish  &#34;cool character&#34; with purple hair who is an outsider (much like Lady Gaga and her little monsters) ..who is coming to realize that he descended from global elites while orchestrating a survival to the death on a &#34;reality TV show&#34; while Bess is shown as the only girl with personality - and one who is boy crazy (ie, not a girl falling in love with nice man, but just filled with lust and hormones) while her breasts pop out of her tops. Do we need to see cleavage in a Her Interactive game?Her Interactive is programming young girls to adopt the mindset and values of the degenerate elites.\"]\n",
            " ['I have been playing these Nancy Drew PC games for a while now, and my daughter and I always are excited when a new one comes out and this time was no different. To put it bluntly, I was very impressed with Nancy Drew: The Shattered Medallion. In this game you are going to be challenged by the puzzles, while also drawn into the story itself. The graphics were strong and it was fun to be able to explore the world of the game itself while identifying clues.I was surprised in this game to not really have an antagonist per se. Usually in the games there is an evil character that acts in this role, but in this game I felt that this was missing. This does not mean that the interactions between the characters were not strewn with innuendos and veiled contempt (at times) as sometimes it was.One of the things that anyone playing these games for a while will appreciate is that you finally get to meet Sonny Joon. This was an event that has been anticipated for a while and even when you meet him here there is mystery behind his appearance that brings even more fun to the overall game itself.The game offered great game play that lasted quite a while of stopping and starting. My daughter did not want to stop but we had to pace her.In the end I have to say that though this game did not have a HUGE mystery as a part of it, it did have a deep story that was built into it that will help you to better understand the characters and delve even deeper into their interrelationships.*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*']\n",
            " [\"The setting: New Zealand. The plot: A reality TV competition in the great outdoors. These two starting points gave this game all of the keys it needed for a great adventure. But it was just the opposite. In fact, in the 15+ years that I've been a fan, this is the worst Nancy Drew game that I've ever played (and if you read some of the other reviews, I'm not the only one who thinks so).The only pro: mostly good characters. Having Nancy's two best friends along for the ride was fun, and all of the people in the game (save 1) had interesting personalities, and good character development.The cons: everything else For example...-The tasks in the competition were almost completely random, & too simple to figure out (I knew where things were before I could even get to them in the game)!-None of the puzzles were new, they were all repeats of older games.-The only unique items found in the game remain un-solved (and so does part of the ending by the way)...-The side-plot was also not unique, it was a bad spin-off of a couple of older games.-The graphics and music were not anywhere as good as any of the last 4 games.-This was the shortest ND game I've ever played, and it was more annoying than fun.Granted, I am much older and harder to please than many who play the Nancy Drew adventures. I can imagine a tween enjoying this game. But I still would have a hard time recommending it simply due to the references of global warming and evolution that pop up in the game. They're not explained well, and really have nothing to do with the story-line, making them inappropriate.HerInteractive, I'm hoping you're already putting much more effort into the next game.\"]\n",
            " [\"Pacific Run: New Zealand is a reality show that has all the usual quirks: contestants that are arrogant and willing to throw people off the bus, an announcer that makes silly puns, a season &#34;villain&#34; and &#34;heroine&#34;, and ultimately a conclusion that has you feeling good in the end. Oh wait...this isn't a real game show, this is Nancy Drew: The Shattered Medallion! (MED)PLOT: (6 out of 10)I found it really interesting that a reality show would be the ideal setting for Nancy's next case, especially after the Silent Spy's serious tone. Overall, the beginning of the game seemed promising. When the game show elements start to collide with the mystery; however, things start to get confusing pretty quickly. There were quite a few times where I would scratch my head and think &#34;Should I focus more on solving the mystery, or winning the competition?&#34; In that regard, I felt limited to my choices, mostly because I wanted to win and not stand around. After playing the game twice, I did notice that regardless of how hard you try in the challenges, it's impossible to win/lose because the story isn't built that way. I find this really interesting because HeR did a really good job letting us fall into the &#34;facade&#34;. It felt like being on a real game show!The best way to approach MED is to take it with an open mind. Don&#8217;t come into it with the idea that you&#8217;re trying to solve a mystery. Instead, go into it with the idea that you&#8217;re a contestant on a game show, and also just so happen to be a really good detective.CHARACTERS: (5 out of 10)The people this time around are pretty memorable. The only problem is that when you have a character like Sonny Joon in the spotlight, all the other characters seem boring and pale in comparison.As for Nancy's friends, Bess was hilarious. She was probably the best character in the game, hands down. At many times, I would burst out laughing because her dialogue was so comedic and believable to her character. George proved to be a great team member as well, providing all kinds of detailed and helpful clues to the game's mysterious plot.The suspects - or contestants - had their own niche or personality, and it came across well when talking to them. I just felt like HeR had a hard time trying to put the &#8220;mystery&#8221; in this game show. While there are moments when suspects may be hiding something, Nancy doesn't do anything about it. What made recent installments like Deadly Device and Ghost of Thornton Hall so intriguing was that each character had a dark secret that had to be exposed. When you take that away, they just come across as regular people, with no real reason to want to talk to them:Leena and Patrick complimented each other very nicely, mostly because Leena had the attitude and Patrick was the philosophical, amiable type. Kiri felt like a typical, stereotyped game show contestant, which made her lines very clever and unexpected. The other, unimportant contestants were even really funny to listen to as well.I can tell that HeR was trying as hard as possible to incorporate Sonny Joon into this case, which was good and bad. When we finally meet Sonny, it&#8217;s done in a very quick and blunt way. I was expecting Sonny to talk about the coincidences of past cases with Nancy, and without that connection, his character ultimately became one with everyone else. I wish there could&#8217;ve been more Nancy/Sonny time together, but it just never happened.As for phone friends, Jamila makes a reappearance. This time around, she&#8217;s less on the crazy side and more practical. Whenever something about Sonny confused me, Jamila did make the situation more understandable. She did come across as a little cryptic in her messages though, which makes me wonder if we'll be seeing something or another very soon...GAMEPLAY (6 out of 10)&#8232;Note: My first play through was on Master DetectiveOverall, the gameplay is just about the same as the last entries. I did like the kayak racing and underwater puzzles. The only puzzle that got me very stumped was the end-game, to which I had to look up in the strategy guide for extra help. The puzzles in general were not too difficult and also not overly insane either. I did have a lot of &#8220;aha!&#8221; moments, which made me feel good at different parts. I also want to put it out there that I loved the word search puzzle, probably my favorite in the game!Talking to characters doesn&#8217;t include any dialogue trees, so it doesn&#8217;t matter what you say to them. I miss being able to say the wrong thing to a character, or snooping and having a character catch you in the act. None of that was really present here.There are a few areas that did bother me:1) The only area that felt a little clunky was the underwater room where the subs are. I was expecting a 360 degree turn feature, but instead it's just clicking to turn. It really made the area very awkward to traverse in, despite how beautifully designed it was.2) The Puzzle Palace's two arcade games were both ripped from a previous Nancy Drew game. Why couldn't we get two new games that had a New Zealand/adventure theme to them? Sure, it's great to have references to past games, but if I wanted to play those, I would've installed &#34;that&#34; Nancy Drew game. Very poor creativity.3) The earlier puzzles in the game that involve multiple stations for different teams felt eerily quiet. It would've been really cool to hear characters like Leena and Patrick fight over how to solve a puzzle.4) Sometimes when Nancy says something, she says it so fast that I get confused about what I'm supposed to do with a puzzle. One example of this is in the cave with the rotating letters. HeR should include a &#34;repeat&#34; or &#34;question mark&#34; button to help explain a puzzle again, just in case we go away and come back to the game again.SOUNDTRACK (7 out of 10)If there&#8217;s one thing that keeps improving with every game, it&#8217;s most definitely the soundtrack. The adventure and puzzle songs were great! The only gripe I had was that the same song would play on a loop sometimes, which kind of ruined my experience for me. I also didn't like how the Puzzle Palace didn't take more advantage of the Puzzle Song. It's my favorite song in the entire game, hands down.ENDING (4 out of 10) (Without Spoilers)I noticed that a lot of people didn't like the ending. I actually found it to be really exciting. For the first time in the game, we finally get some great character development, rising conflicts, and really comedic humor! And then it ends there. When it comes to the culprit, I can justify their actions through the course of the game, but the confrontation just felt out of place. I think it's because we were expecting a huge and fantastic ending, and it just didn't happen. Instead, HeR was trying to go for a philosophical and &#34;deep&#34; approach, which was apparent but not really seen that way.Conclusion (5 out of 10)&#8232;MED was hit or miss for the most part; and that's pretty disappointing. The puzzles were fun and engaging and the soundtrack was amazing. The plot just needed some fine tuning and more intro/closure involved.If you&#8217;re a fan: Just get it, and interpret it for yourself. There&#8217;s a lot going on and the adventure was fun. Just keep an open mind when you play it.&#8232;For new players: If this is your first Nancy Drew game, get it, but just keep in mind that not all the games in the series are like this. That&#8217;s what I think makes veterans like me a little disappointed by the overall quality of MED.\"]\n",

There isn\\'t even an introduction other than the game-show host introducing the show. I don\\'t know why Nancy was there, and I don\\'t know what the mystery really was. The game show isn\\'t even set up very well. It feels deserted, there are no instructions. It\\'s not programmed very well, either.

At one point, the video confession 9 for a character came available with confession 8 not even having been posted yet.The storyline with Sonny isn\\'t that interesting.

It isn't until an unfortunate event later in the game that there is any sort of intrigue at all. It's really not like Nancy was here to &#34;solve&#34; anything, as has been the tried and true formula of the 29 previous games.So the &#34;games&#34; continue - if you can call them that. We only actually SEE 3 teams throughout the duration of the game and they just sit around basecamp doing nothing. If this is truly a race, where is the sense of urgency? No one even seems to care that they are there or even act like they are trying to beat other teams. Then we have a non-existent production team that was unfortunately delayed by customs, but somehow the game show is still being filmed for TV. Well maybe that is the mystery - invisible men manning the cameras??? Ok, yes, that was sarcasm.PLOT POINTS - 0Atmosphere: Music was good - kind of reminded me of the tribute's music from Hunger Games. Locations were good, more choices to explore than in some other games and set in New Zealand. Can't go wrong there.LOCATION POINTS - 1MUSIC POINTS - 1Acting: Nancy doesn't even blink an eyelash when another team's player falls into a pool of water and knowingly can't swim. Just letting him sink to the bottom is a new low for ND. The TV show announcer was completely annoying and grated on my eardrum every time her voice was heard.  Then there is Bess - pathetically desperate over a guy. You can tell the writers for this game weren't woman, because this really did not empower the Bess character at all. So Sad.  But, The real disappointment was Sonny. For years we all wanted to know more about the mysterious Sonny. The reality in this game is that Sonny is just plain weird, crass, and somewhat boring.ACTING POINTS - 0Duration and playability: The game was WAY TOO SHORT!!! It is absolutely ridiculous to be able to finish a game so quickly - a few short hours. The puzzles weren't even up to par. One message that needed to be decoded, was just passed off to another player to solve. We didn't have to earn the solution at all.

I got him this PS3 version so he and his friend down the block could play together...in the same house...or he could teach his old mom how to play.  If you have a child that is a gamer, you know how hard it can be to get any time to interact with them.  Since I personally haven't played the PC version, I asked my son to tell me his opinions on the two versions to help me with this review.Likes:1. The co-op play and split screen so that he can have someone right there next to him playing.2. Good graphics. It is made to look more old school for graphics, but it still looks good on the PS3.3. Not choppy. No lag.4. Good extensive tutorials for newbies.  I found them very helpful.  My boy said there were too many and that he would just rather explore and experiment like he had done with the PC version.Dislikes:1. The controls on the PS3 are more complicated than on the PC version.  He said he notices it more when hunting or fighting. He said he sometimes has to use multiple buttons for simple actions. I would blame this on the PS3 controllers themselves.2. There is less to do on the PS3 version than the PC. No mods, maps are not infinite. You have to pay for skins.3. PC version gets regular updates to game play which this one does not. Maybe with the PS4 version they will address these issues.Overall, we are very happy with the game.  It has some differences and limitations that the PC version does not, but it is not totally gutted like other cross overs.  Our favorite part is getting to sit on the couch and play it on the big screen.  Both this old lady just learning, and the seasoned professional teenager recommend you pick this up.\"]\n",

Fortunately, there is an extensive tutorial that teaches the basics of crafting and building. You run around in first-person perspective, chopping, digging, and doing all sorts of other stuff. I would describe it as a sandbox game -- you're free to do what you like, and the game will not stop you from doing stupid things like digging yourself into a hole so deep you can't get out without building a staircase. (Not that I totally did that, or anything!)The blocky graphics are cute, especially the boxy 8-bit animals. I was not crazy about the fact that you must kill animals to get certain resources (leather, bacon). What can I say -- I'm soft-hearted when it comes to animals.My 13-year-old nephew is completely hooked on this game. I can see why.\"]\n",
            " ['This PS3 version of Minecraft is a blast, just like its PC and XBOX clones. Listed below are some of my favorite features and a few features I did not like.Favorite Features:1. Play Minecraft on your TV/PS3 in HD: Being able to use a big TV for Minecraft makes a real difference in enjoying the expansive terrains and various biomes.2. Built in tutorials: Unlike older versions where you had to learn everything as you played or consult the internet, this console version includes a beginner tutorial to familiarize users with the basic actions in the game and controls.3.SPLIT SCREEN!: This is by far my favorite feature. Being able to run around your world and build and create with someone sitting next to you adds a new aspect of fun to survival and creative games. It is great to play alone in your world then have a friend jump right in to help you build great structures, care for crops and livestock, or explore the virtually endless randomly generated world.Least favorite features:1. Not Cross platform: I know there must be technical issues to overcome but since this game is such a faithful recreation of vanilla Minecraft, I wish I could play with friends who have the XBOX or PC version. Unfortunately you cannot.2. Console controls tough for some PC players: When my friend who loves PC Minecraft plays with me he is always complaining about the controls being so much better on PC. This may just be his preference.3. No Modding: The PC version of Minecraft has every mod imaginable to change the way the game plays, from DAYZ survival style to Pokemon capturing. Unfortunately these are not available for console users.Overall Minecraft is an incredible game that can be very satisfying and peaceful, and frantic and frustrating. This PS3 version has everything from the vanilla game so you can mine and craft on your console.This game is the PERFECT solution for PS3 owners who love Vanilla Minecraft and want to split screen with friends!']\n",

But the big addition is split-screen multiplayer, which works great. Tired of scratching your head trying to figure out just what the heck your kid is doing for hours on end? Fire up the console and join in! I still don't quite have a handle on everything, but I do have at least a better understanding of the game's appeal now.

            " [\"We are no stranger to Minecraft at our house. My 12 year old son is a confirmed legomaniac and loves video games. Could there be a more targeted customer for this amazing, free-roam, sandbox game ? Over the last couple of years we have seen Minecraft on the PC, the ipod Touch,MICROSOFT Microsoft Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition / G2W-00002 /, and the most recent release for the PS3.I grew up with some of the early consoles, and gaming today is not what it was in the 70's and 80's - for better or worse. Minecraft is an awesome game that the whole family can enjoy. There's problem solving, and creativity, and just plain silliness stretched out across this blocky playground that may well remind you of those early days of gaming.As much as my son enjoys the ipod version because he can take it on the road, there's no denying what a console version of Minecraft brings to the table. First and foremost, you can enjoy a much more expansive take on the world. Its just so cool to see all of these blocks stacked, broken down, and rearranged to create everything from axes to castles on the big screen. The multiplayer aspect also allows you to play with your friends just like the good old days when you would spread wooden blocks out on the floor and build together.There are still some things that just make my adult brain twitch just a bit. Things like chopping a tree down from the bottom up and having the leaves just float in the sky. And islands can float in the sky, too - complete with animals that 'spawn' on them. Its just one of those things that makes Minecraft so wierd and fun. If you've got aSony Computer Entertainment Playstation 3 12GB System, and you love to be creative, you need to give Minecraft a spin. Just be warned... This thing will gobble up a lot of your free time.\"]\n",

            " ['I remember when Minecraft was first created a couple of years ago. Back then, and even up until recently, it didn\\'t look that interesting to me. I\\'m into all kinds of different games and genres, but Minecraft just didn\\'t pull me in when I\\'d see gameplay videos. Late last year, my daughter really got into it when she\\'d visit her friend\\'s house, and not long after, it finally got ported to the ps3, which she immediately used a gift card on. Since then, no other game has gotten as much playtime, and I get to see her creations an an almost daily basis. She\\'d create dozens of worlds, all with something different and unique from one another, and while I was glad that she was playing a game where you could be so creative, I still wasn\\'t that interested.Then I started up a file for myself and I got it.Minecraft is a game that this past console generation desperately needed. All-ages games of great quality are rare, and kids usually get the short end of the stick when it comes to games aimed at them. Unless it\\'s Skylanders or Disney Infinity, there aren\\'t many other options. Sure there\\'s Rayman, Sly Cooper, Mario, Little Big Planet, the Lego games and a few others, but they\\'re few and far between. And it just so happens that it appeals to people of all ages too. There\\'s nothing really \"kiddy\" about it- Minecraft is a solid game worth checking out if you haven\\'t already.There\\'s no real story here- you start up the game and enter a randomly generated world where you get to do whatever you want. Your world could have lush forests, massive beaches, tons of rivers, or mostly be water with just a couple of small islands (as was the case when I started my first world. That one quickly got deleted). When you start out, you don\\'t have anything, so you need to walk around and destroy things with your fists, taking the material with you in block form so you can make things out of it. Crafting is challenging and fun, and there are -tons- of things to make. You\\'ll probably start out by making a pickaxe out of wood, mining away at stone and rock so you can make a better pickaxe that won\\'t break as easily. Then you can break up stronger materials that make for strong homes, which keep you safe from the various monsters that come out at night.The number of things you need to make in order to make better things is overwhelming at first, but you\\'ll quickly get the hang of it. Break up a tree to get wooden blocks, get x number of wooden blocks to make wooden planks, get x planks to make a sword and so on. Rarer materials like diamonds can make super strong swords and armor, making you a nightmare for Creepers and zombies. Making homes and buildings is a blast, and more simple than I expected. You just set down the blocks, as if you have giant Lego bricks, and insert things like a bed, stove, windows and more as you get the appropriate materials. You can even make potions to enhance your weapons and other things.Minecraft is one of those games where there\\'s really no \"point\" to it. You do what you want. It sounds boring at first, and the easy-listening soundtrack may not help that impression, but once you start playing and see just how time consuming things can be, it becomes fun. Once I saw how long it took to make a house, a steel pickaxe and find materials I needed for other stuff, I had a whole new respect for my daughter and how much time she put into each of her worlds. When I saw just how big the worlds can be, and how deep you can go underground while mining, it really put things into perspective. And don\\'t even get me started on the steps needed to face off against the game\\'s \"boss\". If things get too tough in the game\\'s main mode, Survival, there\\'s also a Tutorial mode to help you understand things better, as well as Creative, where you can pretty much do whatever you want with unlimited resources and no worries about dying. This may take some of the fun out of the game, although if all you want to do is build a world however you want without having to spend a lot of time getting the right materials, this is the place to go. The best thing to do when you\\'ve gotten the hang of things, is to hop online and invite a friend into your world, or go to theirs. Have fun exploring the area, which I can almost guarantee will be completely different from yours, what with the number of worlds that can be generated.Visually, there\\'s not much to say about Minecraft. it looks like an 8-bit game that got 3D treatment. That being said, it looks good for what it is, and I rarely experience slowdown. As I mentioned above, the soundtrack is on the snoozy side, with some relaxing piano tracks that loop, and there aren\\'t many voices to be heard aside from grunts and growls.Notch, the creator of Minecraft, is pretty much rolling in cash with the success of this seemingly simple game that started out as a downloadable title for just a few bucks. Word of mouth helped the game become the phenomenon it is today, and I gotta say, he\\'s earned it. Now, you can\\'t go anywhere without seeing a kid in a Creeper shirt or seeing merchandise, from key chains to big foam swords and pickaxes. It reminds me a lot of when Mario really got popular in the early 90s when games weren\\'t anywhere near as big as they are today. Perfect for people who just plain enjoy playing games or creating things, Minecraft is here to stay.']\n",

Visually she thought the game looked great but she got bored because you have to do the same thing over and over again. She said when you died, you had to start over again with nothing so that was a turn off. Just to let you know what kind of gamer she is, her favorite games are Need For Speed and the Lego (Batman, Indiana Jones, etc). I'll spend some time with her later and see if her opinion changes.\"]\n",
            " ['Minecraft for PS3 is a lot of fun, but with a few drawbacks. It feels like a complete game, but when compared to all that the PC version includes, it doesn&#8217;t feel as fantastic of a game. The PC version has infinite world size, while the PS3 version&#8217;s worlds are actually quite small. There are lots of materials missing as well. The game is still lots of fun, but just not as complete. The controls feel great, aside from the awful PS3 controller. There is also no actual full multiplayer like PC. You can just join your friend&#8217;s game, more like how you can on Pocket Edition. No matter how much is missing though, it&#8217;s still Minecraft, and it&#8217;s still a blast to play. The other thing about this is that there are no mods, and texture packs/skin packs cost money. The skin packs are set designs too, so you can&#8217;t design your own skins. I feel that once it comes out for PS4 and Xbox One they&#8217;ll be able to make a game near identical to the PC version because of how powerful those systems are.

However, once I started playing this with my kids I found out how addicting and fun it is. It's actually caused me to stay up late(way past bedtime) when I should have been sleeping.This game is challenging but in a fun way. By that, I mean it challenges your mind and more than likely(I hope) increases brain power and function. Maybe best of all is it's a great way to spend time with your family; even my wife digs this game and she's not a gamer(the nerve of her!). Don't let the 1980's graphics deter you, this is an immensely addictive and rewarding game that I think any age group will thoroughly enjoy.

Not much, you might think.  However, with Minecraft the only limit is your imagination.  It's as much a canvas as it is a game.  And that's the genius of this game.  No rules.  Just imagination.  You can build anything, and I mean anything.  There are so many tools at your disposal that you can be a digital Michelangelo or DaVinci if you wish.  It lets the dreamers become doers. Hey, you DID build that.But for me there's even a better reason to buy this game.  Namely, it's a fantastic way to connect with your son/daughter, niece/nephew, younger sibling(s), etc.  My nephew is about turn nine years old.  He lives in Manhattan.  I live in Utah.  A couple of times a month we hop on our PS3s (we both have the digital version) and just goof around.  We mostly hang out in creative mode (we occasionally take on mobs and trade with villagers in survival  mode), building our world which so far includes three huge houses, an airport complete with runway and air traffic control tower, a restaurant, two towers with a skybridge, a huge swimming pool and a race track that runs through all of it.  And we made it all together.The PS3 version, unfortunately, has a lot of limits when compared to the PC version.  No mods, limited skins (so far), etc, but you can play split screen, which is a huge plus for spending some quality time with your kid(s).  I've found the PS3 multiplayer far easier to navigate than the PC version, too.If you don't know really where to start, ask your Minecraft fan to craft you some armor.  After that ask him/her about Creepers, Herobrine, Ender Dragons, Red Stone, and diamond armor.  And then listen.  Watch that kid's face light up as they explain to you the in's and out's of Minecraft.  And then pick up a controller and dive in.  They'll guide you and they'll love it.Trust me when I tell you your kids will never forget the times they got to play Minecraft with mom and dad.**update**. the PS4 version of Minecraft will be released in August.  If you purchase the PS3 version from the playstation store, or played online with the disc version, you can purchase the  PS4 version via the playstation store for $4.99.

Where\\'s the fun in that?\"When I decided to play it and review it, I was amazed at the reactions I received - not from my friends, but from their children! They couldn\\'t WAIT to tell me their stories about fishing and building minecart tracks and fighting Creepers with diamond swords and battling the Enderdragon...I hadn\\'t even played Minecraft yet, but they were all excited for me to start!GAMEPLAY:Minecraft is an open world game where you create your own gameplay experience. Initially, it looks very simple - you play as an adventurer in a block-style format, and you need to gather items and mine for rare ores to craft items for your adventurer to survive. There isn\\'t much of a story to speak of, and while there is a \"boss battle\", you don\\'t have to fight it if you don\\'t want to. During the day, you can see animals and interact with them - horses, sheep, cows, pigs, wolves, and many more. You can dig and uncover rare ores to fashion new weapons, armor, tools and construction materials.However, when nighttime rolls in, you need to beware: there are several creatures which hunt you down - spiders, zombies, skeletons which shoot arrows, and even the dreaded Creeper - a monster which explodes if you linger too closely!You can play in a peaceful style where no monsters chase you and you aren\\'t in any danger, but this limits your gameplay experience. I decided to play in survival mode, to get the full effect of the game.WHAT WAS IT LIKE, PLAYING FOR THE FIRST TIME?I was afraid I\\'d be overwhelmed, but the tutorial mode was extremely easy to follow. It showed me step by step how to get wood from a nearby tree and do some basic crafting. Once this was done, I gathered more materials and put a crafting table together. I fashioned a crude pickaxe for mining and made a wooden sword to protect myself from invaders. With my confidence raised, I created a new world and found a nice stretch of land where I decided to make camp.I thought I was so smart, building a fence to keep out intruders, only to discover I forgot to make a fence gate! I couldn\\'t jump over the fence, so I had to dig under it like Charles Bronson in The Great Escape...which brought a lot of laughs to my child. While I played, she told me about all the dangers I would be facing. I asked how she knew all of this (since she\\'d never played before), and she answered with a chuckle: \"Come on dad, EVERYONE knows about Minecraft!\"TROPHIES:There are 29 trophies to earn in Minecraft, most of which are creation based. You\\'ll get a few right off the bat by creating various tools and weapons, but some of them (such as killing the Enderdragon or riding for 500 meters in a minecart) will take considerable time and effort to earn.In all honesty, this is probably the first time I\\'ve played a PS3 game where I haven\\'t been concerned about earning all the trophies as quickly as possible - and I\\'m one of the biggest PS3 trophy junkies you will ever meet. My enjoyment of Minecraft comes from creating the best game experience for me...whether it\\'s building a house, fighting a skeleton, crafting new armor, cultivating crops, or finding some of those rare jukebox records!SO...HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?Well, I\\'ve come a long way since my first Minecraft session. I\\'ve made a well-fortified house with stone walls (zombie proof), a crafting table in one corner and a furnace in the other. On the opposite side I\\'ve put three large storage chests, stocked to the brim with various items in case I meet an untimely death from any monsters that roam the wilderness. I have torches which hang on the opposite wall from my bed, so I can drift off to sleep peacefully.While I play, I have the choice of listening to the Minecraft music (which is quite soothing), or I can play any music I\\'ve saved to my PS3. I can fish while listening to \"Sittin\\' on the Dock of the Bay\", tend my crops while playing Pink Floyd\\'s \"Learning to Fly\", dig for rare ores to the tune of \"Canary in a Coal Mine\"...the options are pretty much limitless.Even when I\\'m not playing Minecraft, I\\'m thinking about Minecraft. I think about mining for rare ores and creating new structures. I think about finding a new area and setting up a house before the night sets in. Even now, while writing this review, I\\'m thinking about finding the next secret Minecraft has waiting for me.But most of all? I\\'m thinking about my nephew\\'s face lighting up like a Christmas tree when I tell him about my first steps into this world of limitless creation. He\\'s quite the fan, having made a Pinewood Derby race car modeled after a Creeper, and his last birthday party was Minecraft themed.I\\'ve become \"The uncle who plays Minecraft\" - this allows my nephew and I to have fun discussions which weren\\'t possible before I jumped into this game.FINAL THOUGHTS?If you like your video games with scripted starts and finishes, plenty of action or lots of shooting, Minecraft might not be for you. However, if you\\'re looking for a fun game to play by yourself or with family members which encourages creativity and imagination, Minecraft is definitely the way to go.Very highly recommended!']\n",

            " [\"Update on June 27, 2014: My original 2 star review is below, and I'm revising it down to 1 star today, five days after the original review.  After using this mouse for less than two weeks, it has become nearly useless.  The mouse stops working and freezes every few seconds.  I tested it with two laptops with the same results.  Unfortunately, this mouse is going into the garbage.Original Review: This is a decent mouse, but not one I'd use for gaming.  It seems like more of a novelty item with the shifting, light-up colors.  It was fun to watch for a few minutes, but I could see it getting distracting after a while, especially if you use it in a darkened room.  And it does not appear that there is any way to turn it out.  (A manual might help, but that's not included.) The styling on the top of the mouse is also a bit gaudy-looking.I use a Razer Death Adder for gaming, which I believe could be considered a mid-range gaming mouse.  Comparing the Klorts to that mouse, it's lacking.  It's made entirely of hard plastic, and it gets uncomfortable quite quickly, which is compounded by all of the sharp edges.  The scroll button doesn't move very easily, and when I try to scroll upward, my finger can just slide right across the surface of the button if I don't push hard enough.  The side buttons are also impractical.  They're quite narrow and are positioned near the top of the mouse and are hard to get to if you're trying to act quickly during a game.If this was marketed as an everyday mouse, I might give it three stars.  But as a gaming mouse, two stars seem fair.Note: I received a sample of this product for review.\"]\n",
            " [\"The KLORTS wired gaming mouse is such a freaking absolutely awesome mouse that... my foster teen swiped this 6 button mouse the instant he saw the mouse was COLOR CHANGING.  That's teens for you.  It's GONE.  Swiped from my laptop, it's now firmly in his grip, attached to his convertible tablet, I'm not ALLOWED to touch it again LOL SWIPED I say, it's GONE.During the time I was able to use the mouse (until he got home apparently!), I noted there are two buttons on the left of the mouse near the thumb.  I wasn't used to them being there so I bumped them a few times - the nimble teen has had no issues with this, in fact apparently it really helps his gaming controls!  There are the standard 2 buttons on the top of the mouse, plus a scroll wheel/ button and a 6th button that I never did fully actually figure out what that button did before it vanished from my grip.  He's been oohing and ahhhing ever since he vanished to his room with The Kool Mouse, so I presume he's figured out the 6th button.  While likely not the mouse for your average mom, it's probably the koolest mouse the teenagers have ever seen!  Grrrreat for gift giving.  True I received this mouse for reviewing purposes, I don't know that I'd actually buy the mouse for me, but I would indeed consider it when I owe the teen or active gamer a token of appreciation. And besides, it does look really cool on his desk, continuously changing colors like a disco ball.\"]\n",
            " [\"This TechtTop Prince of the Elves gaming mouse from KLORTS is designed for serious gamers, with a braided cable over four feet long and controls for DPI plus a psychedelic and ever-changing LED show that glows beneath a unique crackled soft-touch plastic coating.It also has an extremely ergonomic design for comfort over hours of usage.  The large size is comfortable for everyday use and the buttons are helpfully labelled.The only thing about this mouse that disappointed me was that it doesn't work with my Mac running the latest version of OS X.  I'm guessing that a driver needs to be downloaded, but there are no instructions or information in or on the packaging, and I couldn't find one on the internet.  It does work quite well with a Windows 8 laptop, simply plug & play.A sample was provided for evaluation and review.\"]\n",
            " ['My old Microsoft 3000 wireless mouse was on its last legs, so the arrival of this unique mouse could not have been better timed.This mouse is definitely an out-of-the-box type design, built with angles resembling a Klingon warship instead of the prototypically round mouse. This mouse has internal lighting that phases in and out of several colors including red, blue, green, purple and various combinations thereof. Additionally, it glides and tracks smoothly and the buttons operate seamlessly. I like it... and so does our teenage son, who has now claimed this mouse as his own.We have Windows 7 and Windows 8 laptops in the house and the driver for this mouse set itself up very quickly via the plug \\'n play routines on both machines. No problem with setup, and no issue at all with use. I found the size of the mouse to be very comfortable; it is larger than the standard laptop mouse, and it is angular instead of round and smooth, but that was very much to my hand\\'s liking.The colors that this mouse presents are very vivid in all light conditions, and the look is really cool. However, the colors were very difficult to pickup when taking a picture of the mouse as the flash just kept washing them out. If you would like to see picture I took of the mouse, please navigate to the mouse\\'s main sales page, scroll down to where the \"Most Helpful Customer Reviews\" section starts, and look to the right of that area for the \"Product Images From Customers\" section.  It is very interesting looking and well constructed.The Amazon sales listing notes that the seller\\'s policy includes a \"1 Year warranty\"; if an issue arises within that timeframe, I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this mouse gratis from the manufacturer and have put it through its paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.This mouse installed and operates fine on our Windows 7 and Windows 8 laptops, and it even worked fine on our Samsung smart TV! For the most part we never need to use a mouse pad as table and desk tops work just fine with this mouse. The only recommendations I might offer the manufacturer would be to include a users manual with it so we would immediately be able to ascertain what each button\\'s function is before testing them out, and to add the ability to turn the mouse lights off.If you are looking for a wired mouse of this size, style and design, for use as I have described above, based on our experience I recommend giving this fun & funky mouse a try. Works well for us!Go for it.']\n",
            " ['Throughout the long decades of computer use, I have run the gamut with controllers, from extreme cheapies to wallet drestuction high-ends. Everyone has preferences, and one of mine has been for wired controllers (running out of battery juice in the midst of a pitched battle suXXors), and I have repeatedly found the lower, mid-range to consistently have longevity and comfort (a low-end Kensington mouse being the one I used up to the point I got this KLORTS Techtop free for review purposes). And for the price, the Techtop sure packs in some comfort, smooth response, and bling!I spent more than a decade heavily playing MMORPGs and gone through dozens and dozens of mice, including an ill-fated Razor, and in all earnestness, the Techtop has to be a top contender out of all of them. A comfortable rubberized, slightly textured top-grip with SIX well placed buttons- dude, I wish I had this baby when I was pwnzing suckers with just a three button mouse and keyboard. I remember about a year ago I had looked for a mutiple button mouse, but at the time the prices were either far, far more I wanted to pay or had terribad reviews (why I ended up with the Kensington). Techtop satisfies.One aspect I have always demanded in a new mouse is size. Seriously, I cannot stand those \"mini\" laptop sizes. I need them to fit the palm of my hand. In width, length, and girth, Techtop is probably one of the largest I have experienced, leaving about an inch from my fingertips to the buttons\\' edge when resting my hand comfortably on it. So those with giamongous hands, take note.I uploaded a photo of my standard full-sized Kensington next to the Techtop, but for some reason the product page is not showing it (although it is sitting under my review profile). Bummer, but I will leave it up in case it finally shows up.The grip design is angular as opposed to rounded, which may be a consideration for some. I find it comfortably ergonomic, but I had my brother test it out on his mega-gaming Alienware (he is the FPS/RTS fanatic). He found the right edge uncomfortable for his sausage ring finger (his current one has the rounded ergo-swoop design). In truth, he does choke up quite a bit on his mouse controllers, forcing his ring and pinky to trail over the edge, as opposed just resting the palm on the lower end. He would have kept this mouse if it wasn\\'t for that.And of course the glowy bit. When I showed it to my brother, he was \"Woah, cool!\" The mouse has internal lights that shift through seperate spectrum of colors, not unlike those under-carriage UFO car LEDs one sees on occasion. Heh, this adds some trippy lighting effects in a darkened room. There isn\\'t an toggle to turn them off beyond shutting the computer down, however, so I cannot guess at their overall, continual longevity. A simple switch probably would have been a nice touch. The heavy cloth textured mouse cord is 4 feet 4 inches of pratical length, so those with alternative USB access placement may need to measure the distance.I tested the mouse on my Alienware Laptop running Win7 Ultimate, my brothers Alienware Desktop with Win7 Proffessional, and an Asus Netbook with Win8 Starter. The mouse worked flawlessly with all three, the Win7s self-installing the USB Mouse Driver and the Win8 immediately accepting.All in all, for the very competitive price, this puppy delivers all the features, comfort, and bling that I really dig.Things to consider:* 52\" of practical cord length* Grip position (are you a low-rider, like me, or a high-gripper, like my brother) and the angular design* If you are one who always leaves the PC running, the internal lights will stay on* It\\'s large, so be sure to keep your available surface real estate in mind']\n",
            " ['I am not a gamer, but when I had the opportunity to test out the KLORTS WIRED GAMING COMPUTER MOUSE, I didn&#8217;t want to pass it up. The design of the mouse is more angular than it is rounded. Personally, I enjoy the feel of it more than I do the usual mouse I use with my computer. I also enjoy the &#8220;fractured&#8221; design of the mouse. In addition, the KLORTS WIRED GAMING COMPUTER MOUSE glows colors: it glows one color and then morphs into another color. It&#8217;s a great effect.The mouse has six different buttons. For someone like me who basically just uses a computer for word processing and Internet surfing, six buttons are too many and I occasionally find myself accidently hitting the &#8220;back&#8221; button on the mouse. However, if you are a gamer and use a computer for extended game play, the number of buttons and their placement on the mouse is probably perfect for you.When first connecting the mouse to the computer, it takes a few minutes for the software to upload and initialize, so you have to wait about 15-30 seconds before you are able to start using the mouse. It should be noted that the cord of this mouse isn&#8217;t the usual plastic cord, but is instead made from cloth. I found that rather unique and also a way to give this mouse some &#8220;green&#8221; and &#8220;eco-friendly&#8221; cred.Overall, the KLORTS WIRED GAMING COMPUTER MOUSE works well for a mouse and seems to be a mouse that gamers might benefit from having. I was provided a sample of this item from the manufacturer in exchange for a possible review.']\n",
            " [\"Bought an Xbox One during 4th of July weekend, expecting to be blown away and looking forward to the exclusive titles like Titanfall.  I already own an Xbox360, actually bought 3 of them over the years, and have almost 100 games.  I was pretty much expecting to stay withhin to Xbox family.Then I started using the Xbox One.  The Kinect kept disconnecting, I had disc read errors, video glitches, hard crashes, and the OS is a complete nightmare to try and navigate.  During the middle of some games, i'd accidentally bring up the Snap menu and it drove me absolutely crazy.  This was just the first night of owning the console.As the days progressed, the problems got worse.  Finally, on Sunday, I took the Xbox One back to the store for a refund, and even though I spent $120 on games I will never get back and have an Xbox Live membership valid until 2017, I bought a PS4 instead.  I just could not deal with how poorly designed the Xbox One was, especially at the price I paid for it.The PS4 is a clearly superior system that is fully baked and ready to go.  The difference between the two were stunning and in nearly every way the PS4 blows the Xbox out of the water.  The only thing Xbox did right was give you a longer charge and play USB cable.  The rest of the system is a waste of money.  Save yourself the frustration and the buyers remorse.  Get the PS4 instead.\"]\n",
            " [\"Hey there. So I finally was able to go buy an Xbox One. I own both the Xbox One and a PS4. Got my PS4 on release, got my Xbox One yesterday. I bought the Xbox One WITHOUT the Kinect. I have no interest in voice commands or motion gaming of any kind any more. Once Project Natal was stripped from us I see no point in it. Something like Natal was what the Kinect was made for, THAT was the revolutionary gaming experience that Kinect would have brought, not waving your arms around like a retard and shouting commands to AI squad-mates.My initial impression of the Xbox One is only semi-favorable. During setup the Xbox sat on that green XBOX ONE screen for WAY to long! There needs to be some kind of indicator that there is something happening behind the scenes there. I thought I had bought a bum Xbox. Patience prevailed. A few minutes of green screen finally turned into a setup process. Another rather minor bump was that the Xbox wouldn't connect to my wifi so I had to connect an ethernet cable, no big deal. Just moved it across the room to my desk with a few spare 24&#34; PC monitors so it was in reach of my router. I hooked up an ethernet cable and was updating.An almost 800MB update seemed a bit much. Can't they flash the firmware of the Xboxes to the most current one so future buyers can skip that or at least get a smaller update? The update only took a few minutes at 5+MB/sec but still, it's something that we shouldn't have to deal with anyway.My biggest complaint is that disaster of a user interface. Never will it be any clearer that they designed the UI to be used WITH a Kinect and not to be navigated by a controller. Without voice commands, navigating that disgusting UI is...horrible and is something no human being should ever have to do. Tiles in the store seem to be splashed up on the screen willy-nilly with no real sense of organization. The FIRST thing you should see in the store is the Games with Gold. If you haven't seen what games are free this month somewhere else, how would you know what they are? There is no mention of them anywhere in the store. Also, once you o get into one of the lists of games how about alphabetical lists?? Using the Snap function is not a viable option. I just don't think it can be done with a controller. Again, this is literally only my 2nd day with the console though. Also there is a weird B button issue that doesn't sit right with me.Now that Microsoft has been told by the masses for a SECOND time that Kinect is NOT a thing, they can get around to designing a reasonably usable UI for for this console.As for games I can't speak about much other than the couple of demos I have played and Killer Instinct. Killer Instinct is still a wanna-be fighting game. It was terrible in the arcades and on previous consoles, and it's terrible now. It LOOKS great, but plays like a Street Fighter game with downs syndrome. That comes from over 20+ years of playing Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, and SNK's fighting games. The beta for Project Spark is AMAZING! I can't love that game enough at this point! I plan on putting a WHOLE LOTTA time into that one for sure! The Koding is pretty cool and is REALLY easy to grasp. The different ways it can be utilized is probably damn near limitless! I have high hopes for the final release of that game!I look forward to discussing this console here more in-depth with some of you!\"]\n",
            " [\"Xbox one will give you a great experience and great games with a perfect online service. And the controller OMG! Very High quality and Comfortable.  So don't worry get your Xbox one and enjoy.\"]\n",
            " [\"Microsoft shot itself in the foot when they launched the Xbox One. If they hadn't bundled the Kinnect, the Xbox One would have stood a better change competing with the PS4. In my opinion all human augmentation devices like Kinnect, Move etc are just gimmicks that work only 70% of the time but look great on paper and commercials.That's the reason I went straight for the PS4 and waited months later before taking the plunge on the Xbox One, because to me, the Kinnect was a useless unnecessary investment not worth the extra $100, privacy concerns set aside...Having waited this long I can say the console looks promising. First impression was better and won the Xbox One some points in contrast to my first PS4 unit which arrived with a blue light right out of the box. Feel free to look at my past reviews and my prior verified Amazon review to see that I'm not a fan boy like most of the trolls here who live with their mom and dads and can't afford the luxury of enjoying both consoles.Physically the console is gigantic when put side by side with the PS4 but unlike the PS4 it has more internal space to breathe and thus is less noisier (those who have played Killzone on the PS4 know what I'm talking about). If you're about aesthetics you may like the PS4 a lot better.The controller feels a bit better than the PS4's which is a drain on the battery due to the always on LED indicator. Additionally, the triggers have force feedback which makes the experience a lot more enjoyable when playing racing games such as Forza 5.In the visuals department I have to say both PS4 and Xbox One perform great. Forza 5 and Ryse look very good but nothing earth shattering.I have experienced some lag when playing Forza 5 which I found very disappointing for a next gen console, but the PS4 has had its hick-ups too like game crashes when playing Killzone (later fixed with a software update)IMO, Killzone is the crown jewel of the PS4 and shows how much more powerful the PS4 hardware is compared to Microsoft's. I have yet to see an Xbox One game that looks this good. I only care about exclusives here, since that's the sole reason I buy consoles, otherwise I stick to my GTX 780 gaming PC for playing games.Start-up times are also a lot longer on the Xbox One compared to the PS4 but Microsoft is being sneaky about it by never shutting the console down after the first boot. Instead, the console is put it into sleep mode. This is given away by the light on the power brick that never turns off. This behavior can be changed from the Settings menu though, and once changed, cold boots will increase ten-fold.In the gaming department I believe neither the PS4 or the Xbox offer a lot when it comes to exclusives, but I believe the PS4 has the upper hand with Killzone, Infamous, Infamous, Knack, Resogun. Sure, Forza 5 looks good, and so does Ryse but that's about it. Tinfall is not really an exclusive being available on the PC also, and the rest of the yet to be released exclusives are months away from being released.I'm not going to review all the media-hub capabilities because I have not used them nor I intend to. The main reason I buy consoles is strictly to play games the old fashioned way, with my two hands and ten fingers.Verdict is get both consoles, the power lies with both.\"]\n",
            " [\"This still isn't worth it. Weak console overall. Buy a PS4 instead.\"]\n",
            " ['I love this console. It brings your living room together perfectly.The software has been improved so much since release. no longer are there tons of glitches and bugs, it runs smoothly and fast. First update took about 2 hours, but my internet is slow. Titanfall is a great game that entertains me for ours on end. 100% reccomend*What I like:*[+] The dashboard is integrated WAY better than the Xbox 360 and PS3. There is no longer the feeling of \"in a game\" or \"in the dashboard\". You are ALWAYS in both. Say you are in the middle of a game but want to spontaneously change a system setting or launch another app etc. Both the 360 and PS3 had some semi-dashboard functionality built into the dashboard/home button, but most everything required you to first exit the game and go to the dashboard (aside from some shortcuts to go straight to a different game). Now, you press the dashboard button and without interrupting your game in any way, you now have access to the full dashboard and settings, etc. There is really no such thing as being required to \"quit\" a game anymore, which is awesome.[+] Speed. I always was surprised that through the entire life of the Xbox 360 (including the 360 S and 360 E), there was an unacceptable amount of lag on many core dashboard functions. Something as basic as showing your list of games, or list of gamerpics to change to, or achievement lists, or loading marketplace screens, would often take several seconds of waiting to populate. The Xbox One\\'s startup is acceptably fast, but basic things like loading marketplace content or my list of installed apps, achievements, etc, is very quick. Switching between game and dashboard is no longer the slow annoyance it used to be, but rather is nearly instantaneous.[+] Dashboard Layout: The Xbox 360 dashboard was too cluttered and poorly organized, in my opinion. There were many different \\'sections\\' to scroll through with LB and RB that made it take longer than necessary to get around. The Xbox One dashboard only has three now, it\\'s much cleaner and simpler. Your pinned games/apps, main section to switch back to currently in-use game/app or browse your other apps, etc, and the third section is for browsing/downloading new games/apps. Very easy to navigate. It\\'s also completely add free. Though at launch, the Xbox 360 had very few ads, and over time Microsoft worked a lot of extra advertising space into the design. So let\\'s keep our fingers crossed that doesn\\'t happen again, especially when you are a subscribing Xbox Live Gold member! I also like the notification and achievement changes. You can earn 0-point achievements in random apps, like for watching videos and such. It\\'s admittedly pretty pointless, but if you don\\'t like the idea of pointless achievements, you can easily ignore their existence.[+] Built-in game DVR. Very cool feature that removes the need for external recording equipment for anyone interested in that. Even if you don\\'t plan on using this feature, it could still benefit you in the form of more & better guide videos from other people that will likely be swarming onto YouTube.[+] The controller. Controller design has come a long way since the old Atari joysticks or uncomfortable NES gamepads. I have used Sony\\'s Dual Shock 3, Nintendo\\'s Wii U Pro controller, Xbox 360 controller and Xbox One controller. They are all fantastic. But I must say I always liked the 360 controller the best. The Xbox One controller is simply an improvement upon that one. The only downside to the 360 controller was the mediocre D-pad, which has definitely experienced a massive improvement in the XBO update. They also moved the guide/dashboard button higher, which I like since I used to accidentally hit that when I meant to hit Start/Back. I even like how they redesigned the battery to go inside the controller. It takes slightly longer to swap a battery out, but since I use the USB cable to charge instead of swapping batteries (no Quick Charge Kit yet exists for the One like the 360 has), that doesn\\'t matter at this point. The only thing I don\\'t like is renaming the Start and Back buttons. \"Press Menu\" sounds way less cool than \"Press Start\" you\\'re used to on any game\\'s splash screen.[+] Noise levels and cooling/reliability. Anyone who had a launch Xbox 360 or launch PlayStation 3 knows what I\\'m talking about. Those things were LOUD. Distractingly loud. The Xbox One\\'s internal fan is very large compared to the launch 360 (google photos if its internals). Large fans can move more air and are not as loud as small fans. This also helps with its reliability, as the Xbox 360\\'s biggest launch issues were overheating problems. Microsoft learned from this and I guarantee that will not be an issue here. I wanted to make sure of this, so I have literally had my Xbox One powered on almost 24 hours a day for the last week since launch day. This is because if it\\'s going to overheat, I want to know now rather than down the line after the warranty is up. And I\\'m killing two birds with one stone because Killer Instinct has some goals related to how long you are in practice mode, so I leave it idling in practice mode while at work. Yeah, call me crazy. But anyway, so far, it has handled being constantly on for days at a time with not a single issue.[+] The HDMI-In is definitely a unique feature to the Xbox One that the other consoles can\\'t touch. It\\'s not for everyone; you might not care about it. But it certainly opens up some neat possibilities. Any other HDMI-enabled device you may be interested in using can be switched to and from at a moment\\'s notice. I plugged my Wii U into mine. I could certainly live without the HDMI input, but since it\\'s there I may as well experiment with some interesting ways to use it.[+] I obviously can\\'t speak for everyone else, but my Xbox One console, disc drive, and controller, all function flawlessly and had absolutely no issues.']\n",

Controller is just as good as the 360 with a much improved D-Pad. Totally recommend this console for gaming and just overall entertainment. Only thing I like better on the 360 is the user interface. It was more user-friendly but that will get an update later. Can't wait til this Fall's game lineup with Destiny and the Master Chief Collection. Happy gaming!\"]\n",

I had just returned the one I purchased at Amazon, pangs of guilt really, there is a GameStop near my house (6 miles, near some great burrito restaurants ).  This morning my 360S ate a disk, well, that was it\\'s end.  With all the points I had at Gamestop and all the points I would get from the purchase (PS4 or Xbox) new console would make it worth it.  Of course there was a great burrito on my mind for the post purchase feast.  It never happened, I ran home to set this machine up.The Xbox One set up really quickly, the update which runs at the of the first startup really went fast, I guess there wasn\\'t a lot of internet traffic, it ran in 10 minutes, I signed in with my Xbox Gold ID and lo and behold, everything came back, except of course new games and stuff (music and videos) I stream in from my Mac through NullRiver 360Connect.  I noticed my HTR was telling me that I was receiving a DTS encoded signal from my new Xbox One, sweet.  I thought the improved spatial sound quality and clarity was in my head, it was, it came through my ears.So now, in spite of a currently limited application base, they have my two favorites, Amazon Instant Video and Netflix.  Everything looks and sounds beautiful.  I purchased a new copy of \"Watch Dogs\" with some of my bonus points and the game play was really great, I think I\\'m really loving the Xbox one, as I type this review I\\'m typing away I\\'m watching a show done in 1080p with some really nice sound, all in all, this box is totally worth it as a streamer if nothing else.  Sure I played Watch Dogs for a few minutes and then went back and listened to some Xbox music, all done in Dolby Digital, which my Mac Mini won\\'t do, but any modern PC will, but that is a subject for another day..What a treat, I got to hear some real sonic imagining and separation, not the usual cacophonous mush that comes out of my Mac Mini.  The Xbox one looked around my network and at my history with Xbox music and in a few minutes my  entire music library was up and ready to go.  Look, I\\'m like a kid with a new toy, I will probably be up in an all night media fest, if for no other reason than I\\'m enjoying the sonic imagery and great picture quality.The games will come in time, but right now, an Xbox is once again the primary quality streaming device in my system, now I can have over 100 TB of additional storage and I already have 6TB on the Mac\\'s desktop.  All in all with trade in and bonus points the whole thing was a deal.  This is one really nice piece of hardware, serving both as a console and multimedia center.  It\\'s even pretty and is size wise it\\'s about a 2U rack mount, small and sleek enough to look good in your home theater center.  The 360 S had a great sound chip, the One is has an even better sound processor as well as a much better graphics processor.Microsoft was right in some of their ideas about integration into Home Theater, it is a good thing, because so few pay attention to these details,  which make the Xbox One a great piece of equipment for any home entertainment system.  The Xbox Gold network is about as secure and reliable as networks get.  Most server rooms are populated with MS Server Products as I\\'m sure the Microsoft network is.  This is an advantage Microsoft holds quietly over other console vendors.When my Xbox 360 S died this morning all I could think about was the pain of replacing it, once I took it the Xbox One out of the box, the Xbox one took very little time to set up and started producing high quality material with a low signal to noise ratio and great gain to the preamp.

This worked until I reconnected to wifi  and then was told I needed a 9GB (!) mandatory patch before I could play the game.  Now after installing, uninstalling, downloading the patch and everything all I get is a black screen when the game is booting up.  I'm so disappointed.  I was looking forward to the line up of games coming out for the One, but this is ridiculous.  If they can't have the system debugged 6 months after it was initially released then this is unacceptable.

Removal of kinect is like removing a critical part of the xbox one experience that I feel sets it apart from the PS4. Both are great consoles, but kinect gave it a much more wholesome feel.

They start you off with standard 2 AA batteries (lame), but changing batteries isn't nearly as convenient when your controller runs out in the middle of battle.  You could also get their rechargeable battery, but you have to use wires to recharge it (I hate wires)- Headset:  This is probably my biggest peeve with the Xbox.  If you have a wireless headset, you can only use it if it has a digital microphone out and then only if you buy Microsoft's buggy headset adapter. I HATE WIRES!!!- Can't play Xbox 360 games and there aren't a whole lot of Xbox One games out yet (but same issue with PS4)As a note the Xbox User Experience is focused on having a Kinect, so not having it makes some things more difficult and a couple things you just can't do at all.  Voice Commands with the Kinect sometimes result in you having a shouting match with your xbox, so if you are looking for a cheaper way to get a really good gaming and entertainment center, this is a good option\"]\n",

The xbox one is constantly being updated with major updates being released once a month, each update brings new innovative ideas and already the xbox one is a much better console than it was when it was released back in November of last year. I guess buying the base console makes it feel more game focused.There are a lot of great xbox exclusive coming in the future.

All these excellent games are on Xbox only. Also GTA V is coming to xbox one and ps4 this fall.and If your concerned about the graphics being slightly better on ps4 that's bull, people always said the same thing about PS3 having better graphics than 360 but it never really did(i own ps3 and 360 so i know).

I was one of those people who wasn't fond of such an idea. Even though I buy mostly new games, I didn't like that the disc was pretty much a coaster after you installed it, as I'm the kind of gamer that likes to have a collection of physical games and not have everything online-only. So I wasn't going to buy an Xbox One.Fast forward to them announcing that they were doing away with the awful DRM stuff and I was sold. I then pre-ordered one along with a PS4. While I was turned off by their original plans for the console, they heard the complaints and did the right thing, even if it was a tough pill for Microsoft to swallow.So now what we have is a game console like any other. Whether it's a new or used game, it'll work, and this is the way it should remain for any future game consoles. As we saw with the PSP Go, the digital-only model doesn't work for this industry unless we're talking Steam.Onto the console, the Xbox One is a large device and pretty weighty, but it has a very reliable feel to it. The Blu-ray drive is quiet and takes the disc smoothly, you can hardly hear the fans, and the whole thing is generally whisper quiet. In addition, the user interface is smooth and works very intuitively with the new Kinect.And let's not forget the Xbox One controller which feels like a durable and well-made piece of hardware including an improved d-pad and ergonomics from the Xbox 360 controller.Here are some 2014 exclusives still on their way:Sunset Overdrive - The new open world sandbox action game from Insomniac, the creators of Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet & Clank, and Resistance. Featuring beautiful art direction, a huge world to explore, lots of free-roaming, vertical parkour allowing the player to reach great heights, etc.D4 - The new game from cult game director Swery, the mind behind titles such as Extermination, Spy Fiction, and Deadly Premonition. It looks original and interesting for fans of his work.Halo: Master Chief Collection - 4 games, 3 confirmed for 1080p/60fps, the other 1 being worked on to reach 1080/60fps by launch, and over 100 multiplayer and co-op maps. Halo 2: Anniversary graphics completely redone from the ground up with new CG cutscenes.Ori & the Blind Forest - Looks to be a beautiful and emotional journey unlike anything else out there.Below - One of the most anticipated independent titles.PS: I also own a PS4 which I posted an Amazon Verified Review of. Overall, both are great consoles, but I prefer Xbox One.\"]\n",

Even if you go by the Titanfall bundle's regular price of $499, the value of this SKU is still worse.  So don't mistake this for a price drop, it's an un-bundling/cheaper SKU.At 399, you really have to consider the PS4 as well.  It has more powerful hardware for the same price, which means most multiplatform games will look better and/or perform better on PS4, and multiplatform games make up for ~90% of both system's software libraries.  If Xbox One exclusives interest you more, then it's a decent system.  However, I would only recommend this SKU if you don't care about Kinect and you just want the cheapest Xbox One available, regardless of value.

This season follows Dexter&#8217;s pursuit of the Ice Truck Killer&#8212;a sadistic serial killer that chops bodies into pieces after draining all of their blood.

              " \"This isn't one of those shows or movies about a serial killer who just does it for fun.  Dexter Morgan targets people very specifically and only those whom he believes have crossed a line or violated one of his standards.  For example, Dex would never molest or kill a child, so he kills a man who has done such things to choir boys.  This is not a defense of Dex, just a clarification.What makes him even more complex is that he did not suffer abuse at the hands of his loving foster parents; he maintains a good relationship with his sister, a cop; he works as a forensic examiner for the police; he fakes emotions as best he can with  his girlfriend and her kids; and feels nothing at all, most of the time, unless it's a sense that he must get rid of someone.Michael C. Hall's performance and voiceover work are very strong. He's stretched out further than he could with his character on the late, great Six Feet Under.\",\n",
              " 'If you\\'re reading this you either are 1) a fan of the show 2) want to know more about it to see if it will appeal to you. Michael C. Hall (\"Six Feet Under\") plays Dexter a vigilante serial killer. By day Dexter works as a splatter analyst in the police department using blood patterns to help determine exactly how a crime occurred.We have a true anti-hero as the focus of the series--a serial killer who almost seems to have a conscience because he focuses on dealing out justice (and focusing his urges)to those he feels are evil. His father a police officer instilled a code to help him direct his \"urges\" and distinguish between good and evil.Showtime has attempted to improve the quality of their shows and their DVD releases with some mixed results. I found the image quality to be anything but subpar for a DVD. It\\'s a very good transfer. Is it high definition? No, but this isn\\'t an HD-DVD and the quality for a standard DVD is very good although there are some digital compression issues that crop up occasionally.The one complaint I have is simple--no chapter indexing where you can see specific scenes for each episode. Sure you can skip through it by hitting the next button but it\\'s kind of unusual in this day and age for new shows to NOT have this. The second is minor and others have pointed it out--the menu is a very basic design that looks like it could have been done by an amateur.You also have to reset audio for each disc as you watch it for 5.1 as it automatically defaults to 2.o. To be sure many of these are minor points but they do contribute to the enjoyment of the show if handled well.The special features are an improvement over some previous Showtime series but far from perfect. We get two episodes of the excellent Showtime drama \"Brotherhood\". We also get \"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation\" a very good featurette that focuses on splatter analysis and what it reveals about a murder. It ties in to \"Dexter\" because that\\'s what Dexter does for a living on the show and it also helps him to break a number of cases. We also get a commentary track that I haven\\'t listened to yet as well as an online link to watch two episodes of the new Showtime series \"The Tudors\" and a pdf file with the first two chapters of the new Dexter novel. I suspect that \"The Academy of Blood: A Killer Course\" is along with the DEXTER novel excerpt buried in the DVD-Rom portion of the disc. You won\\'t be able to watch it or access it on a regular DVD player which is just plain sloppy as this isn\\'t indicated on the package.We also get biographies for the actors. While the extras here (including two commentary tracks on the set are very good, the show could have used more commentary tracks and the involvement of star Michael C. Hall on at least one of them. Also, the special features really need to be more clearly indicated as to whether they are DVD accessible, PC accessible and where you might find them on the disc.Minor Plot Spoilers:Dexter\\'s father a police officer recognized early on his son\\'s proclivities and tried to give him moral guidence and boundaries so that he can function in our world but, more importantly, use his \"skills\" to hunt down those that prey on others.Dexter is conflicted--he knows that he\\'s not normal and he also knows he doesn\\'t fit in (he has difficulty with emotions having to fake his way through it). He also recognizes what he is and how his father tried to shape him into something \"better\".When he goes toe-to-toe with the Ice Truck Murderer and tries to track down this nasty serial killer he gets a glimpse into his own soul but also recognizes that unlike his evil doppleganger he can choose his actions and not just act on his instincts.END OF PLOT SPOILERS:Overall, Dexter is a terrific show. The second season has also gotten off to a bold start. The first season used the novel DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER as a starting point. For the second season the writers/producers have chosen to depart from the novels which should make for an interesting move. This is a solid set that could be improved with future seasons.',\n",
              " '\"Dexter\" is built on an intriguing premise: a man with antisocial personality disorder experiences murderous impulses but lives by a code - he can only kill murderers.  Kind of a twisted play on Freud\\'s concept of sublimation.  The series didn\\'t initially appeal to me, but overall I\\'m pleased that I stuck with the first season.  Michael C. Hall plays the titular character, a forensic expert in blood splatter.  He works alongside a group of detectives assigned to some of most brutal Miami murders; one of these cops is Dexter\\'s adopted sister, Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter).  Dexter was adopted as a child by a Miami cop (the now deceased Harry Morgan) who recognized that Dexter was antisocial.  Instead of allowing Dexter to go down the path of juvenile delinquency (and inevitably murder), Harry developed a code for him - you can kill but only under certain circumstances.  Harry also encouraged Dexter to do things to make him seem normal, such as dating, to help him hide his true nature and go undetected.  Most episodes feature Dexter stalking a serial killer, with a season long plot involving Dexter\\'s fascination with the \"Ice Truck Killer.\"The series features excellent writing and direction, which helps make the somewhat unbelievable premise feel realistic.  The acting also is top-notch.  Hall does a nice job of making Dexter charming and likeable (so that we can believe that he can fit in at work and his relationships) while also adding a bit of edge through his lack of true emotion, superficial charm, and violent impulses.  We can sense that evil lurks just below the surface, kept in check only by his adherence to his code.  It\\'s a solid portrayal of an extreme case of antisocial personality disorder, and the series isn\\'t afraid to make its protagonist dark and somewhat frightening.  The supporting cast is also terrific, with C.S. Lee scoring as Vince Masuka, Dexter\\'s lascivious co-worker who is a walking sexual harassment case.  Likewise, Sgt. Doakes (Erik King) helps lighten the mood as the only person who seems to know that Dexter is not the good guy he portrays.  I also enjoy the work of two \"Oz\" veterans - Lauren Velez as Dexter\\'s complicated Lieutenant, and David Zayas as Detective Angel Batista (perhaps Dexter\\'s closest \"friend\").Although I enjoyed the show, there were a few things I disliked about the first season.  Debra\\'s insecurity is highly grating, and the actress gives a twitchy, affected performance.  Dexter\\'s flashbacks to his days with Harry become extremely repetitive and unrealistic after awhile.  The first few episodes were difficult to watch, and Dexter came across as quite brutal; I was ready to give up on the series after these shows, but the character became more \"human\" in subsequent episodes.  Finally, the last two episodes of the season, which focused on the Ice Truck Killer case, were overly melodramatic and lead to a rather unsatisfying ending.  Although I approached the series with some trepidation and found it flawed, there\\'s enough to like about the Season 1 that I plan on watching Season 2 on DVD.',\n",

Veronica Mars, the movie, is essentially a love letter from the cast & crew to the fans.A long time ago, we used to be friendsBut I haven\\'t thought of you lately at all...It\\'s been roughly ten years since we last saw Veronica, back when she was a teenaged private eye poking her nose in everyone\\'s biz in Neptune, Cali. The movie\\'s opening sequence fills us in on what she\\'s been up to. Veronica is interviewing for a place in a prestigious New York law firm that especializes in dumping frivolous cases before they get to court. (So much for what would\\'ve been the 4th Season premise of her landing in the FBI.) Veronica confides that she got out of Neptune when she was 19, got herself a B.A. in psychology at Stanford, was near the top of her class in Columbia law. Interview over, Veronica hopes for the best.She claims that her amateur sleuthing days are in the rear view and her nosy disposition tamped down. And when her bad boy ex Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is implicated in murder and he calls her, pleading for her help, she assures her current beau that she\\'s only going to provide Logan with lawyery advise. So it\\'s back home for Veronica, a reunion with her ex with the baggage and a dive back into a posh but then scuzzy space redolent of leftover angst and reputations ruined and inner demons outed but never exorcised. That unknown murderer lurking in the midst - because it can\\'t possibly be Logan, right? - almost seems a footnote. Just another day in Neptune.The best bits about the television show get reincarnated. It\\'s still ultimately about the underdog, the perceived loser, putting one over the bullies. Very much intact is that marvelous father-daughter synergy between Kristen Bell and the fantastic Enrico Colantoni. Veronica and Logan\\'s relationship is still... complicated. Veronica still cracks wise. She\\'s still incredibly dogged. There\\'s huge gratification in catching up with a host of familiar faces. Everyone came back! Plus, there\\'s a surprise cameo or three. Okay, if you don\\'t know Veronica Mars from Bruno Mars, you won\\'t get it. But this isn\\'t about luring in the uninitiated. See, you\\'ve caught me in mid-celebration. I\\'m still gobsmacked that there\\'s a Veronica Mars movie, and I think we marshmallows suspected it wasn\\'t gonna make tons of money, but so what? Maybe tomorrow I\\'ll watch this again and then I\\'ll notice flaws. But that\\'s tomorrow. This movie is a collaborative labor of love among the filmmakers, the cast, and the ardent, mobilized fans. For now, I\\'m keeping it on the pedestal.The DVD\\'s bonus stuff:- \"By the Fans: The Making of the Veronica Mars Movie\" - a very cool documentary in which Rob thomas, Kristen Bell and the entire Veronica Mars cast take you from its record-breaking Kickstarter launch to pre-production to the first day on set and beyond! Includes a segment from the backers\\' perspectives as they show up as extras on the set (00:55:36 minutes long)']),\n",

              "'With a pretty cool subterranean monster,Tremors(1990) was a fairly successful creature flick, which spawned three subsequent films.  Tremors the TV series, retains many of the original story elements, as events are mostly centered near the tiny settlement of Perfection, Nevada (Population 12), where the carnivorous sand worms known as &#8220;Graboids&#8221;, continue to threaten those residing in the area.  For those acquainted with the movies, the TV program has a very familiar feel, as Michael Gross resumes the role of Burt Gummer, a heavily armed survivalist type, with a passion for killing the creatures who are responsible for the death of his wife.Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, and Gross were the stars of the original movie, with Gross assuming the lead role in the sequels, as the gun happy Gummer was the ideal character to continue the battle to save Perfection.  With Gross as the producer, the TV series features a stubborn group of settlers, who are determined to stay, in spite of the danger.  Newcomer Tyler Reed (Victor Browne) arrives in Perfection, as the new owner of Desert Jack&#8217;s Graboid Adventure, and is quickly integrated into the community that includes Nancy Sterngood (Marcia Strassman), Rosalita Sanchez (Gladise Jimenez), and storekeeper Jodi Chang (Lela Lee).  Melvin Plugg (Robert Jayne) is a developer looking to buy out the residents, while the charismatic Dean Norris (Breaking Bad, Under the Dome) plays W.D. Twitchell, an official from the Department of the Interior.The stories are pretty creative, with some good action scenes, as the settlers are threatened by several variations of the beast, who are attracted to the heat of the human body.  In addition to head sandworm &#8220;el blanco&#8221;, and other Graboids, there are also &#8220;shriekers&#8221;, two legged creatures, that often attack in groups, and even a flying beast known as an &#8220;ass-blaster&#8221;.  The special effects by Encore Visual Effects, and Greg Nicotero&#8217;s KNB EFX Group, are often impressive, much better than you might expect for a TV program.When originally aired on the Sci Fi Channel, the 13 one hour episodes were broadcast out of order.  The DVD release presents them in the order they were intended to be.  The picture is full screen, with image quality being very good.  If you&#8217;re a fan of the Tremors franchise looking for a little more Graboid action, you will probably enjoy this short lived series, which is currently available at really low price.'"

              "\"Out of all the new comedies that have come out in the last ten years, Sunny is as the top of my list.  You need an affinity for quirky, offbeat humor to enjoy it, not to mention a high tolerance for raw language and sexual humor.  The first season consisted of just seven episodes, but established the core characters and operators of Paddy&#8217;s Pub; owners Dennis, Mac, and Charlie, and waitress/Dennis&#8217;s twin sister Dee.  In Season 2 (ten episodes), Danny Devito comes on board as Frank, Dennis and Dee&#8217;s dad.  The show&#8217;s creators (Rob McElhenney/ Mac; Glenn Howerton/Dennis; and Charlie Day/Charlie) are hilarious as actors, and also as writers.  Every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me.  It&#8217;s one of those great ensemble casts that&#8217;s incredibly balanced in terms of the personalities and comedic nature of each character, resulting in a consistently high level of quality in every episode.  These first two seasons have some of my favorites, including &#8220;Charlie Has Cancer,&#8221; &#8220;Charlie Got Molested,&#8221; &#8220;Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,&#8221; &#8220;Hundred Dollar Baby,&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody&#8217;s Ass.&#8221;  Like most fans of the show, I tend to favor the Charlie-themed episodes, and considering that he&#8217;s the only one so far to get movie roles and a gig hosting SNL, it&#8217;s clear how important he is as part of the cast.  But that&#8217;s not a knock against anyone else.  I can&#8217;t really imagine it continuing if they lost any of the key characters of Dennis, Dee, Mac, and Charlie, and even though Frank wasn't there in the beginning, it would definitley hurt the show to lose him.  As far as current TV comedies go, no one else is doing anything funnier than &#8220;Always Sunny,&#8221; and these first two seasons show it.\""
