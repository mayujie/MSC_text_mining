              "\"UPDATE, 12/09/13: this machine is WAY OVERPRICED, now.  I got mine for maybe $400, will check and write an updated note in the comments.  It wasn't worth the amount I paid, much less the selling price now.UPDATE 12/09/13: I finally gave up and reinstalled my prior MFC 9700.  It scans well.  This 8480DN cannot scan directly from the machine, but ONLY from the computer.  However, at least the 8480DN has a power button, along with wire hookup in two ways, parallel and USB.  It also allows you to configure it from the computer, without having to use that HORRIBLE LCD menu.  But I gotta tell ya, I'll never buy another Brother printer again.  They didn't learn any lessons from the insanity of the MFC 9700's frustrating interface.UPDATE 3/22/13:  I upgraded one star for the printer, because there is a way to make it do searchable pdf via its PaperPort function.  But the scanner itself can't do that.  YOU can do tht, if you have Acrobat;  its OCR function will also convert any Google doc into searchable pdf (yay, finally I can search Shakespeare and Gibbon)!  Of course this printer can't do that, but once you scan it, even without PaperPort you can take an old Adobe Acrobat 6.0 and render it searchable.  I still prefer my ScanSnap S1500.I still haven't found a way to directly press the scan button ON the machine and have it scan.  But printer quality is excellent.  The rest of the remarks below, still stand.UPDATE 10/13/12:  the scanner does NOT produce searchable pdf.  This makes the scanner nearly useless.  So I downgraded the printer to 2 stars.  Then downgraded it today (1/22/13) because THE SCAN BUTTON DOESN'T WORK on the machine.  You can only scan remotely, from your computer.  Someone in Brother quality control was very thoughtless.  The machine does have some advantages (see below), but I'm giving this low rating to call attention to the UTTER THOUGHTLESSNESS of the design and the manuals.Gist: If you seek a simple fax/scan/copy/printer, look somewhere else.  If you want a sophisticated version with a small footprint and are willing to accept a light duty cycle (30K pages per month -- meaning really no more than 500 per day) -- keep reading.  This machine has fax/scan/copy/print features I can't find elsewhere except in machines costing 2k or more -- cleverly created and handled.  And, it's reliable, a steady workhorse.  Consumable costs are low, for what you get.  When the thing gets tired after about 7 years, it still works fine, but its menu begins to say its drum needs changing, even though that's not true.It will be easier to follow along in this review if you first download the user's manuals on the 8480DN from Brother.  Just Google on that model number and 'manual download', to find the page quickly.  I will no longer buy any electronic product until I've read the manual.  Here, I'm already quite familiar with this line of Brother machines.  But the manuals are a nightmare, so you do need to read them and decide if it's worth the hassle of learning.  Machine itself is of great quality.  Boring putty gray and charcoal color, but hey: business machines are deliberately dull (color chosen by committee vote always means dullish gray or beige or black, yuck).  Well, this one isn't as ugly as some.  Two-toned.Even so, the Brother MFC-8480DN is MUST-BUY, if you still have DOS word processing, because it recognizes PCL 5 language, which back in DOS days was very common.  I'm so thrilled about this:  all my old Multimate Advantage II merge files print as intended.  (MM II used to be the standard DOS word processing in Fortune 500 corporations, and had the easiest-to-program merge functions ever invented.)  My happy history with the elder MFC 9700 and this newer model's PCL 5-6 emulation, were the main reasons I bought this 8480DN.  Saved my bacon for all my 20+ year old client files.Yet the 8480DN can also handle modern stuff, sporting a dual TWAIN and WIA-compliant, Network-capable multifunction fax/color or b&w; scanner/copy/print machine on a legal-size scanning plate, with PCL 5-6 (emulating HP language as well as PostScript), which is compatible with Linux, Windows (through version 7), and Mac:  you get three CDs (Windows pre-7, Windows 7, and Mac) for that reason.  The TWAIN feature allows duplex scanning, but on the 8480DN, I'm not sure how to make it work.  Might not work at all, in XP and prior.  The instructions are ambiguous, probably because the duplex problem is a WINDOWS problem, not the machine's.  Still, you can scan odd then even pages, and re-assemble in Brother's own PaperPort or even via Adobe, to make into a duplex (so I hear).This 8480DN is not automatically set up to handle wireless, but through its Ethernet port you could presumably plug it into a router.  (The 8890DW is supposedly able to do wi-fi out of the box, AND it offers easy duplex scanning;  but I didn't buy that unit.)  You can download the Linux drivers from Brother.  Go to its website, search on 'Linux drivers', and you should get a page of them, with a bunch of model numbers.  So you download, by clicking on the model.  Brother is big on Linux compatibility.=============================================================Sophisticated FOUR-TIER Operation, and Installation (Outline for this Review)=============================================================So, this 8480DN would be a ten-star machine, except for its infuriating, fragmented,  instructions: some options are scattered in the online manual, some only show in the paper manual, some only are listed on the web; some only, in the machine's menu.  But it has a lot of features.  Witness: there are FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS to run this machine, that's why it's so dang confusing.  Ultimately you'll find one way you want to use it, and forget the other options.  But to begin with, you need to know what your options even ARE.1.  Run the machine from its own menu and buttons ON the machine.  Trust me, you will soon hate doing this.  But you will need to learn it, because the other ways of running the scanner, don't include all the options which are ON the machine.  Some important options, like printer emulation mode, are only available from the machine.  The paper manual is correlated to these options, so is relatively easy to read.But alas, not all options you need to configure, are on the machine, so are not covered in that paper manual. So the rest of this review, will cover tips on 8480DN salient features, plus operation via Tiers #2-#4, plus Maintenance.2.  Run the machine from the Brother Control Center options on your computer.  Totally different organization for the many overlapping options, which basically 'tell' the machine how to function;  neither the online nor the paper manual, correlate the same options in the Control Center.  Worse, the online manual isn't organized the way the Control Center displays. Aaarrrggghh.  Not all of the important options are configurable from the computer.  So you have to go through BOTH manuals, but you cannot program in both places at the same time!  So go through the computer options first, then the machine's own options per the paper manual.3.  Run the scanner from the PaperPort Software.  Oddly enough, this is covered in the online manual, where you don't expect it;  also, as would be expected, from the PaperPort's own Help menu.  In my older MFC-9700, when you scan using the machine first -- meaning, you stick the thing to be scanned in the machine and hit the scan button ON the machine  -- the PaperPort menu automatically comes up on the computer.  So presumably that happens with the 8480DN, too.  So this will be the most common computer experience you'll have, if you start your scans at the machine and hit its own buttons.  Unfortunately, I can't get my 8480DN to operate by simply hitting the SCAN button!  EDIT, 10/08/12: I still can't operate the scan button on the machine, must use Control Center to scan.  Since I don't find anyone else having that problem, I must assume it's something wrong on my end, pending talking to Brother.  They want me to call them, and I can't do that until after the 15th.  One quirk in their program: you can't replace an existing file, even if an administrator.  So if you want to rescan with the same file name, you must save to a different directory or first delete the file you originally made.4.  Run the machine's security and permissions, from the web.  Apparently this is for Networking functions by the administrator.  I don't use a network, so won't review this option.  Its function is in the Network User's Guide put on your computer at installation.  The main functions concern who has what kind of access to the MFC 8480DN.  Because, it has a lot of storage capacity (with added memory you can easily add to the side of the machine, too);  so presumably access to its functions, is relegated to an administrator using the cloud.  UPDATE 9/13/12 -- the manager of a large apartment complex with units all over the place told me her 8890DW was completely and swiftly installed REMOTELY by some geek in another state.  He did it all by commands directly to the machine.  No CD required.  So apparently network installation can be heavenly.The rest of this review now focuses on Tier #2 and #3 usage.  These are the most useful and difficult tiers of configuration features, to understand.  There are over 1000 configurable features.  Sadly, Brother's explanations while good, are VERY disorganized.  You will spend HOURS in the pdf manuals, as a) they have no page numbers, and b) their own search engine is dysfunctional (not Adobe's search engine, but their own.  Why?)NOTE TO BROTHER: Organize the pdf according to the Control Center software screens, to lower confused customer calls? Dovetail the at-machine paper manual with the pdf User's manual, so the user can IDENTIFY common functions, versus functions only ON the machine, or only choosable FROM the computer?  You have a good product, Brother -- but oh brother, the convoluted manuals make us tear our hair out!INSTALLATION TIPS: 1) install the software first. 2) DO NOT hook up the USB or Parallel interface to the MFC until told to do so; 3) leave the MFC OFF until told to turn it on.  4) DO NOT select 'Custom' installation: it sends the installer into a hang, for Brother wants to advertise using its own toner brand;  the installer won't complete, else. So, you must install three times (without uninstalling): a) install first WITHOUT Paperport, then b) install again WITH Paperport, then c) do it a third time, to install the only option left, Brother's PostScript driver. Took me four hours to figure out that a) b) c).After installation, there are HUNDREDS of setup options to analyze: 20 customized presets (maybe more). You can also change options ad hoc, right on the machine, though its now-larger LCD menu remains as annoying as ever.  At least now it's backlit and readable.  Whew.Oh: the 8480DN forgets the time, even if unplugged for a moment. To reset it, call up Brother's Control Center menu and use its Remote Setup, Device Settings, Initial Setup: then check the box next to 'PC Clock'.  DO NOT reset the time ON the machine: your PC clock then can't reset it, unless you reboot. Sigh. Okay, but that's all the bad news:  dysfunctional pdf manuals, and a hypersensitive ticker.  Not too bad.Else, this multifunction machine is a huge improvement over its hard-working predecessor, the MFC 9700, which I've owned since about 2005.  So let's see why.=============================================================What can this 8480DN really do?  LOTS.  To wit:=============================================================**  SCAN or print directly to PDF (and other formats), either via your computer, or by itself, with a handy USB port right in front of the machine;  just stick in a pen drive and convert your files on it.  (I have to test this more, to see how it works.)  You can preset 16 sets of options, but only via the computer.  Quality scanning is very slow.  If you want fast, readable but not superlative scans, accept the defaults of 400 or 200 pixels. File sizes are also smaller.  A quality scan will take maybe 20 minutes.  Frankly I don't see much difference between the umpteen bizillion pixels Brother can do, versus the small file standard, but maybe there is a huge difference in photos.  Scanning options are many, creative, and sophisticated.  For example, say you wanted to make a banner. So you print out sections of this 'banner' and now want to 'assemble' it in a scan as one big piece. You can do that.  Or, conversely, scan to fit as many as 25 pages onto one legal or even smaller page.  You can do that.  You can duplex scan, but in two steps, not one; and you have to use PaperPort (covered below), if you're on XP.**  Duplex or simplex PRINTING in black and white, but color for scanning, selectable to very high resolution levels.  Legal size glass, so you can fit more on the scanner.  You can also size the output to shrink up to four pages onto one page.  Via a special option in Direct Print -- where you plug a pen drive into the front of the machine and print what's on the drive, bypassing the computer -- you can shrink as many as 25 pages onto only one page.  The printing options here are enormous and sophisticated, seen on many high-end machines (i.e., make books or pamphlets).  The machine is silent except when printing.  When printing, the chief sound is the fan, windlike; not harsh.  You can hear the paper revv up, too.  Warmup isn't fast, but is acceptable. 32ppm is about right.  It's fast enough for a small office.  It's aggressive about conserving energy, hence the slower warmup.** ADF of 50 pages, I think.  It looks improved, versus my older machine.  This newer model has a fabulous paper path to make it easier to remove jams.**  You get many REMOTE PROGRAMMING options set from either the computer or directly on the machine, versus earlier Brother models.  You can operate the machine remotely, too;  call into it and 'poll' (receive its stored input).** You can FAX receive/send either directly from your computer, including broadcasting to groups, timed faxes, polling (get faxes from some distant machine, like IRS fax downloads).  The Brother offers many different resolutions and settings you can choose for printed fax clarity; by contrast, its internal PC-Fax function (faxing directly from your computer) is weirdly capped to 200x200 resolution.** You can SCAN to create files on your computer, of course.  Paperport manipulates the scanned pages afterwards (i.e., change page order, formats).  The 8480DN uses Paperport version 11.** COPYing, including with almost-too-many settings for 'cleaning' an original, reduction, enlargement, shrinking up to 4 pages into one page.  Many options in the dialogue boxes to help correct bad originals; the manuals offer good hints, too. Copy and print settings you change on the fly (i.e., lower row of charcoal square buttons) don't change your defaults;  they only change your next function.** NETWORK-capable, has its own Ethernet port.  Hook it up using either parallel or USB.  (I prefer parallel; keeps my USB ports free and less drain on the machine.)  Lots of security options; mind-boggling, how you can configure pinpointed security.** SIMULTANEITY, true MULTIFUNCTION: you can send/receive a fax, print, and scan to file all at the SAME time.  No special setting for this, it's automatic.  I've been in the middle of a scan when a fax came in; or, was printing, on my older 9700.  Or had left something scanned on the plate but scanned something else, with no mixup.  I still don't know why it works so well.  So that convenience continues in the newer 8480DN.** Need more MEMORY?  Simple:  buy and insert the added RAMM into the side of the machine as easily as you'd insert an SSD card into a slot of your netbook.  Default memory claims to support storage of 600 pages of scans (presumably text, not necessarily that high for photos).================================================Now to Tier #2, at this review's start: running the 8480 DN from the CONTROL CENTER.================================================After installation, you access Control Center 3 via subset of the MFC-8480 menu under 'Brother' menu/folder. Ignore its option to use the 'Modern' skin, stick instead to the turquoise default menu. Pick Device Settings, then Remote Setup.  There will be a pause, as the computer loads the settings resident in the machine.  These are fairly straight forward, except for some arcanely-named options, covered below.  As you work with them, remember to periodically hit the 'Apply' button, to save your work to the MFC while editing.  Click the OK button to save and exit.  The Remote Setup Dialogue box's 'tree' headers are:GENERAL:  the oddly-named 'Mode Timer' means the RESET time between the last function you did, and resumption of Fax Mode.  If you turn 'Mode Timer' off, you disable faxing. At times that's helpful, to avoid interruptions; generally you'd want the default of 2 minutes. The setting also controls how long you can repeat whatever you last did, too. So if you've a longish copy or print job, increase the Mode Timer or turn it 'off' to disable any reset to Fax Mode.--- Paper Type and Tray #1 (.5 ream) and MP Tray.  The former is the pull-out tray.  The other is a bypass tray, which they call 'MP'; its door is drop-down: light-gray door on the front of the machine (not the dark gray part for the drum and toner): see the paper manual's page 12.  So you can feed 1-3 sheets or envelopes at a time, via the bypass.  This becomes useful for mixed paper types in a print job, when you code the machine to pause at certain points.  You can also buy another .5 ream pullout tray to attach underneath the machine, for about $200 more.  (The tray integrates into the machine via screws supplied with the unit.)--- Default Paper Type is Plain (think 'copy paper' of Xerox quality, approx. 18-lb); but the 8480DN also accepts thin or thick paper.  The manuals give you great hints on how to tell what's thin or thick by paper behavior -- including envelopes, the #1 complaint users have about this machine -- so you waste less paper guessing. Envelopes are problemmatic in any laser printer;  the cheaper ones are usually the worst.  The thinner, the worse.  As for thick, 65-lb paper qualifies as 'thick' (stiff stock for title pages in presentation folders). Even 65-lb paper worked fine in my MFC 9700.--- Tray Use means where should the machine SEARCH for the paper to print.  Default is the bypass 'MP' tray first, then the pullout ('T1') tray.  Be sure to match the machine's settings to the size paper you use.  You have many sizes to choose, all the way up to legal.--- Glass Scan Size limits how far the scanner will scan on the plate.  So you match that to your actual paper size, as well, lest you get black/blank scan.--- File Size refers to compression if you're printing to a file:  use 'small' if you'll email.  Else, use the default for either Color or Grayscale, to file.  (Acrobat will give you the smallest file size.  Next best is Fujitsu S1500 scanner. This Brother might be as good.)FAX:  Setup Receive's Ring Delay should probably be set to 2, so the fax will pick up on the third ring. The Fax/Tele Ring Time of 30 seconds is usually best, as that's the usual 'handshaking' time between calling and answering faxes, especially if you attached an answering machine (aka 'TAD').  Don't use voicemail, because Ameritech or Comcast or will take the call, so your fax can't 'hear' it.  Attach an old-fashioned answering machine from 1990 or later.--- Setup Send is a little more arcane:  here you can set Batch or Real Time transmission off or on, whether a cover page and what kind, with preset or customized messages. (Frankly, it's easier to create your own cover page, unless you broadcast to many people.)  See pages 45-46 of the paper manual, for details.--- Address Book!  Yowsa: you can type in the numbers and names (they make Vcards), or you can import Outlook or Outlook Express 6 data to the MFC -- but not from HERE!  Oh no, they put the Address Book import option in Control Center 3's PC-Fax, 'Setup' option.  Then, select the 'AddressBook' tab and specify type and file path for your book.--- Report Setting gives you a valuable history log of faxes in and out. I set mine up to give me a weekly report, but you can select it by day, hour, or x # of faxes.  The 'Start At' means what hour, for time.  It might mean something else, if you pick a different option.--- Remote Fax Options:  these control how you want your fax to act, when you're away.  You can have it forward, be paged, have it store in the machine  (so you can retrieve it remotely, which Brother calls 'polling'); or, have it store in your computer.--- Dial Restrictions is a kind of quick password protection, to prevent others or yourself from dialing wrongly.COPY:  You'd adjust these settings for higher than normal resolution. Increase Contrast if copying pencil;  increase brightness if the original is old or discolored.  The manuals here offer helpful hints on how to clean up your originals (esp. what Brother calls 'noise').  So too, the dialogue boxes; play with the settings.  Very nice and rare features.PRINT: to duplex or not duplex, that is the longevity question. In the 'Automatic duplex Printing' section of the onscreen User's Guide  -- it says 'DO NOT use bond paper' for duplex, with good reason.  I'd argue never to use duplex at all, unless you want to shorten the life of your machine, and spend extra money at least once a year to have some professional clean your machine's innards.=====>  GRATUITOUS TREEHUGGING MESSAGE:  If you want to save a tree, go paperless.  If you want to see your printed paper become brittle faster, go duplex.  Its value is way overrated.  Great for book printing, but again you'll just dirty your machine twice as fast, i.e., 100 pages duplexed 50, will dirty twice as fast as 100 pages simplex, for the toner goes on BOTH sides of the rollers.  It's a false economy, and you can always reuse paper on only one side, for scrap...DIRECT PRINT: makes the MFC print directly from your pen drive or plugged-in camera, without the computer.  Here, you can shrink up to 25 pages onto one, in multiple formats.  Could be useful if the computer is off or tied up.SCAN to USB: means you can scan directly to a pen drive, too, bypassing the computer.NETWORK options are fairly straightforward.  Remember that UTC is almost equal to GMC, for the time zone.INITIAL SETUP:  Check the 'PC Clock' box.  Quirk in the machine will keep on unchecking that box, after you save.  That's probably why when you turn off the machine, it forgets the time.  But hey:  my beloved MFC 9700 didn't even have a power button.  The machines are meant to stay on, ever vigilant for faxes.Here you must experiment, with 'Dial Tone'.  Sometimes setting it to Detection creates glitches;  sometimes not.  The 'Dial Prefix' should be '1' (just as for your Fax and Tel numbers), if your stored phone numbers don't have that prefix, or you otherwise have a direct line out.  If you have to dial some prefix to get an outside line, put that in front.  Since the 8480DN is hooked up to the PC, check 'from PC Clock' for the source of the machine's time, especially if you often have power outages.  Finally, if you set the machine to 'manual' fax receipt, then you must type a code, to activate the fax.  You set the code in the Setup Receive option under FAX.Whew!  You're 10% done!  Now let's talk about the other turquoise ControlCenter3 entries above 'Device Settings'.  These, too, don't operate as you'd expect.SCAN: if you left-click, you tell Brother to scan something IMMEDIATELY on the scanning glass, for any of the four items listed.  They are DESTINATIONS for your scanning, so you must program them first.  So you RIGHT click, to configure settings. Next, you'll see a tabbed dialogue box.  Its 'Software Button' is a preset you configure for scanning directly into an application, but USING YOUR COMPUTER.  By contrast, the 'Device Button' is a preset for the SCAN BUTTON on the 8480DN.  So, you have one 'pair' per Image, OCR, Email and File. Thus you can have up to eight presets.  If that much flexibility makes your head spin, set both Software and Device button options exactly alike, so you can use the computer OR the button on the machine, to get the same result.  Repeat: the buttons are DESTINATION-oriented, so you have up to eight destinations, two per type of scan, you can choose.  And you choose, the application DESTINATION for the scan; the File Type, resolution and scan type, paper size.  Also, click 'Scanner Interface' if you plan to crop the image after scanning, or otherwise edit it.  If an application you want to use isn't in the drop-down list and you know the path of the application you want to use, then click the 'Add' button and then click on the folder icon, to browse for that program's location.  Suggest you add MSPScan.exe which is Microsoft's own Document scanning program.  Sometimes it's faster; and like Paperport, offers post-scan file manipulation.=====> SUGGESTION:  pick the highest resolution and quality settings for IMAGE and OCR and FILE; but for EMAIL pick the lowest settings you can stomach.  For your average email ISP services like AOL, Verizon, etc. allow only 5MB for attachments.  So too, the IRS and other Government agencies provide their employees with very limited storage, capping email attachments to about 5MB per email.  (Note: gmail and Yahoo have much higher caps, like 20-30MB per email.)CUSTOM SCAN: this is the same as scan, except that you get to change the icon names, too.  Another 8 configuration options, for Software and Device Buttons.Whew! Now you're 50% done!  Could they make it more complicated?COPY: Here you get four added presets for Copying, when you right-click.  You can even specify different printers, whether to scale (fit) the text to the size of the output page, and other options.  Since it's usually easier to change common copy settings on the machine, these four are best reserved for very special jobs, with maybe 60 suboptions.  Give the presets names which will make you instantly remember what they do.PC-FAX:  Max resolution is 400x 400, in this model;  but if you plan to do delayed or batch/broadcasted (to many people) faxes, PC-Fax can be helpful (see pages 45-46 of the paper manual).  Again, you right click the Send icon to configure it to send faxes directly from your computer, rather than print out and then feed the machine.  Presumably the Send icon setting controls Receive, too, as you can't configure that one's resolution from the computer;  you CAN configure it from the machine, see the paper manual on Setup Receive.Back to the Control Center configuration: If you make a mistake and hit its Receive icon more than once, you get the PaperPort menu, so have to quit and REBOOT, to reset the icon.  So instead, hit the Setup icon. Finally, here you get a sensible dialogue box.  The 'Address Book' tab is most helpful: you can load your Outlook or Outlook Express addresses and phones into the Brother.  Suggest you first complete your Outlook/Express data before you import.  Finally, the Speed Dial tab allows you to configure a special 10 speed dial from your computer.  These will not be the same as what you programmed back in the Device Settings, Remote Fax Setup 'Address Book'. Presumably those latter, match the speed-dial numbers on the machine, up to 34.  (By the way, when you use Speed Dial, the too-white menu on the machine will light up with the name associated with that speed dial number, so you get to SEE the speed dial name, before sending.)Back in the 'Speed Dial' tab of PC-Fax Setup: to configure the special 10, you must manually 'add' the name on the left, to a number on the right.  Again, you can only dial these from your PC.Whew, 70% done!  Are you groaning, yet?================================Now to Tier #3, using Paperport to run your 8480DN.=================================Paperport is a scanner controller plus sorter and converter; it works like moving papers on your desk, into finished bundles.  Paperport has distinct scanner control advantages versus direct machine or Control Center.  You access Paperport from the ScanSoft Paper Port menu item (or programs).  Most importantly, it can make duplex scans.  Here's how: access Paperport, select duplex, and you'll get a cute dialogue box telling you how to do it.  Additionally, you can specify whether you want to scan in TWAIN or WIA mode, an option not selectible (so far as I can tell), via Tier #1 direct on-machine or #2 Control Center operating modes.  It might not work in XP, or maybe it only works with Twain.  I've not yet tested it, just going by its instructions, en ce moment.  Will report back here with the results.Again, Paperport is fairly basic, intuitive.  It has has many fans, and three chief advantages:  a) it's organized like a desktop, so you can arrange stuff on it, move that stuff around into stacks or unstack;  just like shuffling papers into or out of stacks, on your desk.  So, scan of 50 unrelated pages; and then move each of those pages into other stacks, be they photos, charts, whatever.  Then b) you can scan while in Paperport, to add more stuff to reassemble.  Then c) you can export your stacks into a variety of applications which are iconized at the bottom of the screen: like Outlook Express, Excel, Word, pdf, etc.  Paperport is Win7 compatible, so will show compatible apps.  You get these same features with Fujitsu Scan Snap S1500, Adobe Acrobat, and many Acrobat knock offs, my favorite being Smart PDF Creator Pro.  They all work better at arranging and converting, vs. MS or WordPerfect Office.Limited tagging and editing, in Paperport.  I couldn't see any options, but I'm sure there are some.==================================MAINTENANCE==================================This machine requires very little upkeep.  A bit of Windex on the plate once a week or month, depending on how often you scan;  feather-dust everything else, especially the interiors, once a month or more often;  I actually use a turkey feather bought in a craft shop (you know, for kids wanting to play Indian chief at Halloween).  I use it also to clean between my keyboard crevices.  Handy thing.RUN CLEANER SHEETS after a major print job which is dense (200+ pages), else once a week (you can buy these in Amazon).  You can use each of these sheets five or ten times and still get cleaning from them.  They are impregnated with a substance which catches toner and DUST.  Those are the two killers of good output, and if you don't do it, you ask for trouble.  Think of it as the equivalent of not defragging your hard drive.  If you don't defrag once a week, your machine will slow to a crawl.  The sheets prevent that BLACK LINE you so often see in unkempt faxes.  Toner is a kind of dust; it's so fine, that by the time you see little black spots, it's almost too late.  GET THE CLEANING SHEETS.  Any printer needs this.I like those lint-free old flour towels our mothers used to have, for cleaning the plate.  Got any old makeup brushes?  Clean them and use them to dust inside the ADF, especially the rollers.  DO NOT use solvent on the rollers, unless you like a dysfunctional machine.  At most, use a dampened sheet which has no lint (better still, just a soft blush brush which is VERY clean).  Dirty ADFs are a major cause of jams.  Takes a few minutes while on a phone call or watching something on TV.  Once a week.CONSUMABLES:  I think the Brother toner runs about $70, and it lasts a long time.  They say 3,000 pages, but I've gotten a lot more than that.  I still keep the old toners, in case I suddenly need one.  Shake it from side to side maybe once a month or two, to make it last longer.  The toner problem isn't so much that it runs out, but that it sticks to the sides.  When the print quality looks bad, the toner cartridge needs a little rocking from side to side.  Do it over the sink, unless you have black carpets.The drum unit is maybe $100-120, and it too has a much longer life than Brother recommends.  Though, they tell you to ignore the CHANGE DRUM SOON warning until you see degradation you can't tolerate. My old MFC 9700 h\""

The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent \\'prayer of the bone\" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don\\'t get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It\\'s just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.  Lets hope this show continues on for many years to come.']\n",
            " ['I discovered this series quite by accident. Having watched and appreciated Masterpiece Contemporary: Place of Execution, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written, and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the \"cozy\" mysteries such as the long-running Midsomer Murders - Set One and The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, sometimes involving children, almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.The first season contains three main stories, each divided into two episodes:The Mermaids Singing - Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.Shadows Rising - The skeletal remains of a young woman is found, and when further evidence turns up, DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands, one with a penchant for dark-haired young women.Justice Painted Blind - Another unsettling case, this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. This throws up a whole bunch of suspects, including the parents of the murdered girl.The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.The streaming was good overall with only a little delayed streaming during Episode One. There were no glitches on the other episodes. The picture quality could be improved though as it did seem a bit grainy to me.']\n",

You need an affinity for quirky, offbeat humor to enjoy it, not to mention a high tolerance for raw language and sexual humor.  The first season consisted of just seven episodes, but established the core characters and operators of Paddy&#8217;s Pub; owners Dennis, Mac, and Charlie, and waitress/Dennis&#8217;s twin sister Dee.  In Season 2 (ten episodes), Danny Devito comes on board as Frank, Dennis and Dee&#8217;s dad.  The show&#8217;s creators (Rob McElhenney/ Mac; Glenn Howerton/Dennis; and Charlie Day/Charlie) are hilarious as actors, and also as writers.  Every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me.  It&#8217;s one of those great ensemble casts that&#8217;s incredibly balanced in terms of the personalities and comedic nature of each character, resulting in a consistently high level of quality in every episode.  These first two seasons have some of my favorites, including &#8220;Charlie Has Cancer,&#8221; &#8220;Charlie Got Molested,&#8221; &#8220;Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,&#8221; &#8220;Hundred Dollar Baby,&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody&#8217;s Ass.&#8221;  Like most fans of the show, I tend to favor the Charlie-themed episodes, and considering that he&#8217;s the only one so far to get movie roles and a gig hosting SNL, it&#8217;s clear how important he is as part of the cast.  But that&#8217;s not a knock against anyone else.  I can&#8217;t really imagine it continuing if they lost any of the key characters of Dennis, Dee, Mac, and Charlie, and even though Frank wasn't there in the beginning, it would definitley hurt the show to lose him.

At things that aren't supposed to be funny, but as any serious fan of comedy knows, those can be the best laughs. I walked away feeling lighter and happier. If that ain't comedic success, what is?IASIP is like Seinfeld if the SeinFour were ten years younger, Irish, and ran a bar in South Philly. These guys have clearly studied Sein and Curb very closely, and their tight timing and topics and banter are all very Larry Davidesque...but they go places even LD won't. The best two shows of the 7-episode first season are about cancer and abortion; I howled at some moments. These guys have done what so many guys want to do: make a show about how funny they are. Except, these guys really are funny. Sometimes. But hey, no one's always hittin' homers, even on comedy 'roids, so I cut these three some slack and marvel at how tightly they work together. There's a lot to be said for working with old friends, if they have talent: the camaraderie and timing here are born of many years of drinking and laughing and thinking and falling down, no doubt. And these three guys are each pretty dang funny, each in his own fashion.DeVito is ok but I liked the first season best for its rawness. Still, as the later shows get a little more polished it's often in good ways.If you don't like drinking, if you insist on PC language from your friends and neighbors, and if you are in general just plain uptight about people living and thinking the way you want them to, look elsewhere. But If you enjoy tying one on and laughing your butt off at the endlessly silly idiocy that accompanies being alive in America these days, you may just find Always Sunny to be almost always funny.\"]\n",

You'd think the premise (every hour of the 24 episode-long season is played in real-time; thus 24 encapsulates a full day) would get old by now, but, surprisingly, the producers and writers have managed to come up with another riveting, must-see season. In fact, this might be the best season of them all. The thrills and nail-biting suspense (as well as the SPOILERS alert) begin early in the season five opener, with the shocking slaying of President Palmer and assassination attempts on familiar CTU agents (one of which is tragically successful). Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is lured out of hiding after 18 months and becomes rapidly embroiled in a devious conspiracy that goes all the way up to the White House. As he becomes the most wanted man in America (he is framed for Palmer's assassination), he must try to ferret out the true culprit(s) and again save the country from deadly Russian extremists and various domestic villains. On a personal level, he must come to terms with the deaths of personal friends, the alienation of his daughter Kim, and the fact that his former girlfriend  Audrey Raines (Kim Raver) might have moved on.There's a reason why Kiefer won the best dramatic actor Emmy and why 24 beat out the likes of the West Wing, the Sopranos, Grey's Anatomy, and House for best drama. The fifth season is fully serviced by a coming together of story and acting - from the gripping, edge-of-your-seat plot line, with its manic twists and turns, to the no-quarters-given, full speed ahead performances of the cast, but specially of Kiefer Sutherland, who gives his all in inhabiting his role. Kiefer IS the show and consistently produces such driven intensity, lying just beneath an icy cold surface, and yet his eyes reveal a vulnerability of sorts, when he's reacting to something personal to him. He makes a scene work, even without dialogue. Very good stuff. And, no, you do not want to get in the way of Jack Bauer.There are other standouts, of course. Gregory Itzin as the shifty and weak-willed U.S. President makes you gleefully hiss, while Jean Smart as the medicated First Lady Martha Logan brings earnest soap-opera acting to primetime. Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe O'Brian) continues her highlight role as CTU's brilliant but cantankerous and socially-inept tech support operative. Meanwhile, James Morrison, Roger Cross, Kim Raver, Carlos Bernard, Louis Lombardi, and Sean Astin become the season's dependable, solid bedrock.That so many of the regular cast die in this season lends an immediacy to the episodes and exponentially raises the stakes. There's no comfort level at all here, as you're never sure who would survive in the end (but, with this show, were you ever sure?). Even Kiefer Sutherland had played around with the idea of having Jack Bauer biting the dust (Please, no!).So, the 24 - Season Five dvd box releases December 5, 2006, just in time for you to go thru 'em to prep for season six, which begins next January on Fox. Season Six, by the way, picks up nearly two years after season five's finale and will have James Cromwell with a recurring role as Jack's estranged dad, Phillip Bauer. Also joining the cast is Eddie Izzard, Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle), Peter MacNicol, Regina King, and the beautiful Rena Sofer. I can't wait to own season five and, then, to see season six. Long live Jack Bauer!\"]\n",
            " ['Revel in his awesomeness!!! For he is a god amongst men and he is deserving of all praise that can possibly be heaped upon him. The one time the Emmys got something right!! Jack Bauer is as close as any fictional character has become to being superhumanly powerful, and at some times his recurrent circumvention of the bureaucratic system, assaulting his friends and co-workers, his flagrant abuse of \"prisoner\\'s rights\" and his uncanny ability to fight his way out of any trap... it may require a little bit more suspension of disbelief than would normally be necessary in a lesser show, but the very core of this show is Jack Bauer, or more specifially, Kiefer Sutherland and his increasingly better performance each season of 24. When he is having a particularly emotional moment, you feel it exude from the screen.... this is just an example of the power that Sutherland brings to this show. Also standing out as always is Mary Lynn Rasjkub as the wonderfully ascerbic and wicked-tongued Chloe O\\'Brien. The introduction of her character is one of the best things that\\'s happened to this show. But this season has some other stand-out characters: one that was introduced in season 4 and a brand new one. Fans of the show know these as President Charles Logan (the wonderfully slimy Gregory Itzin) and his first lady Martha Logan (the amazing Jean Smart). Their interplay and their performances are almost as key as Sutherland in this season. Another thing that came to be almost an in-joke is that three members of the cast of the original ROBOCOP film appear in different parts of the series, which as a fan of that film was just really cool to see. Whether or not that was intended, it\\'s still a nice touch for genre fans. Julian Sands has lots of fun chewing up scenery as the evil Russian-yet-English-Accented Terrorist. The premise is per usual: Jack must defy all odds to save the country and avenge his personal losses. But the plot itself is of a higher level of complexity and tragedy this season than prior seasons. The way it begins is ALMOST as shocking as the way the season ends. And the ending of the final episode of the season... that scream you heard in the whole of the United States and parts of Canada and Mexico... that was me. January 2007 CANNOT GET HERE SOON ENOUGH!!!']\n",
            " [\"The first five seasons of 24 are the best thriller/escapism you'll find on television. It's fast-paced, big-budgeted, over-the-top (sometimes WAAAAAAAY over-the-top), and mostly clever. But I don't think ANY of the previous seasons (or the lame season 6) can come even close to the excitment and joy of watching this fifth season.Yes this season follows the same (tired) gimick of everything happening in real-time, but what set this season apart for me was it's more focusd plot-line. Several of lead character Jack Bauer's friends are killed or attacked and he's out to find out who and get revenge. Ok, sometimes the overall story arch DOES get side-tracked to the typical (terrorists trying to release poisonous gas), and sometimes it's not always that interesting (CTU gets infiltrated AGAIN!). But none of these side-attractions even BEGIN to take-away from the exciting central story which pushes along at break-neck speed and crediblilty (thanks also to the believable performances of the ENTIRE cast).Like some people I try not to watch the show on TV and much prefer to wait for the DVD to come out which is why I can't recommend buying this season enough (thought why there's not subtitles on every episode is beyond me). Yes it's a couple years old now, but it's still the best (and most affordable) 24 episodes of action you'll find anywhere.\"]\n",

But the treat of terrorists in Los Angeles with stolen nerve gas just might be enough to derail the treaty.Season 5 won an Emmy for best drama, and it was well deserved.  Even after five years, this show is gripping drama with excellent writing and acting.  I am glued to my seat every week, breathing only during commercial breaks.  This season the threat and storytelling seemed more focused then previous years, adding to the drama.There were a couple flaws this season.  I sure don't remember the explanation of who knew Jack was alive at the beginning of the season.  Maybe it was mentioned and I missed it.  Furthermore, we have yet more examples of lack of security at CTU.  While it does make for gripping drama, it does seem like they could come up with a new plot trick every so often.My biggest complaint this season was the body count.  We lost several key characters from previous years.  While I understand the producer's desire to keep us on the edge of our seats, can't anyone from the show live happily ever after?  It honestly got to the point I dreaded seeing anyone who had been on the show before for fear they would be killed off.Still, these are minor issues with a truly wonderful show.

It starts strong and doesn\\'t let up until it\\'s over.As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. Season 5, however, breaks from this tradition and instead packages the discs in 4 slim cases (the 4th holds the bonus features disc). A change of page in packaging, but still quite attractive, with approximately the same shelf footprint (if not slightly smaller).Season 5 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and bonus features. I might note however, they\\'ve added a slightly longer intro before getting to the main menu (looks like booting up and logging into a CTU computer system). However, on my DVD player I could skip ahead without having to play the whole sequence. So, it wasn\\'t completely ungainly.The video and audio were up to par. Of course I don\\'t have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can\\'t test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn\\'t notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I\\'ve noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn\\'t say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn\\'t seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you\\'ll probably like 24 as well. There are some \"intense\" scenes and probably some harsh language, so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters, if at all.']\n",

This season had by far the most suspense as well as the most cliff hangers.  After I finished watching an episode, I usually wanted to go right to the next and watch it right away!  There is, however, a big plot hole in the season.  The fate of Evelyn Martin and her daughter was never covered, and I found that unfair; an entire episode depicted their plight, and I feel it should have been resolved, whether she was killed or left alive by Henderson.Any show that can make a person sympathize with someone while viciously rooting against them (i.e. Logan) is a stupendous show.  24 delivers all of that and more, with its best season to date.9/10\"]\n",

The fifth season of \"24\" revolves around one central mystery: who killed an ex-president and how is Jack Bauer connected to the assassination? It\\'s a thrilling season--probably the best since the first season--and it comes to a stunning conclusion that will be answered in January of 2007. Interestingly after having watched \"Casino Royale\" its clear that the new Bond film was inspired by shows like \"24\" which were, in turn, inspired by early Bond and some of the newer spy thrillers out there. There are a number of twists and turns in this season set my advice is NOT to read any reviews that summarize anymore of the plot if you haven\\'t seen this season as there are some major spoilers in some of the reviews that follow.As usual Fox has put together a terrific DVD. This also features a brief episode \"prequel\" to the sixth season like previous sets had. We get a large amount of worthwhile commentary tracks including some with Emmy winner Kiefer Sutherland. There\\'s also a summary of the season included as well athough if you\\'ve watched the show (or are watching it now) it won\\'t really provide anything new. Th \"100 Episode Reel\" is a pretty useless extra -- basically a clips compilation.Different places are offering different exclusives. If you purchase it here you can download a free episode from Unbox (at least during the Holidays) while Target also offers a limited edition bonus disc for this set with additional featurettes on the show. Regardless of whether you buy it here at amazon.com or elsewhere this set features plenty of extras including an examination of the wonderful Presidential retreat featured in the show, a good featurette on the stellar work by the cinematography on the show, a featurette on the supporting actors on the show as well as extended and deleted scenes. I haven\\'t had a chance to dig through all the bonus material yet but it what I have checked out looks really, really good.This set is packaged in the thinpak holders with two discs per holder so the accordian style packaging has been abandoned for this thinner packaging.

            " ['While Season One of 24 focused much of its attention on President David Palmer, Seasons 2-4 saw the Oval Office by and large take a back seat to the missions of Jack Bauer and CTU.  However, Season Five brings some of the attention back to the sitting U.S. President (this time Charles Logan) and ends up with a much more well-rounded storyline.For a basic (non-spoilery) plot summary, a group of Russian terrorists threaten to release canisters of nerve gas in the U.S., leading Bauer to be reprieved from his thought-to-be death in order to help stop the crisis.  As CTU begins investigating the terrorism, however, it quickly becomes clear that the terrorists are working with a high-ranking government official, and the conspiracy begins to be unraveled.To be honest, at first I was skeptical of all the focus on President Logan, as didn\\'t like his character and wasn\\'t sure that he could command the camera as well as his predecessor Palmer.  However, by the end of the season, Logan is easily the most enjoyable/interesting character on the show.  His acting, along with his wife, chief of staff, and head of security, really gives the show the Presidential presence it lacked since that first season.Of course, there is still more than enough of Jack Bauer and his fellow CTU agents (Audrey Rains, Bill Buchanon, Edgar Stiles, Chloe O\\'Brien, etc.) to go around, which means that intense drama ensues in every single episode.  The writers have an amazing way to take a character that looks like a creep (think Tony Almeida and George Mason in the early seasons) and, by the end of a few episodes, have him become a noble hero, and that tradition continues in this season as well.The only \"knock\" I have on this season is that the cliffhanger endings of each episodes aren\\'t quite as shocking (e.g. Nina Myers doesn\\'t appear out of nowhere).  However, I think that was more of a creative choice by the writers, as the story is actually more coherent that any season besides the first one.  Instead of seemingly changing the plot of the show with every episode, Season Five slowly crescendos until the big finale.So, fans of 24 can purchase this season with confidence knowing that they will still get their action, drama, suspense, and some great twists and turns along the way.']\n",

            " ['It was rough enough for the fans of NCIS to lose Kate Todd by having Ari Haswari snipe her at the end of Season 2.  So, starting Season 3 off by showing Kate\\'s murder from Ari\\'s POV is a little rougher.  But the two episodes that start off Season 3 of NCIS--the two part \"Kill Ari\" episodes--really bring up a subject in this series that hadn\\'t been fully fleshed out.  Obviously, these two episodes allow the regular characters to come to grips with the loss of Kate--the irony of Kate\\'s ghost talking to Ducky and Ducky not talking back to the ghost, the overall story of how the survivors all see Kate.  McGee seeing a superwoman, Abby seeing Elvira, Tony being Tony in seeing Kate (That schoolgirl outfit), and Gibbs seeing Kate as he last saw her--with a hole between her eyes.  Just as obviously, \"Kill Ari\" allows for the introduction of Cote De Pablo\\'s Ziva David, the Mossad/Masada agent liased to NCIS in the wake of Kate\\'s death and Lauren Holly\\'s Jenny Sheppard--Gibbs\\' former partner/lover who rose beyond working the field to the NCIS director\\'s job.But my observation after a couple of viewings of this box set is that the underlying story of the season is the revelations about the history of Leroy Jethro Gibbs.  For much of the first two seasons, Mark Harmon\\'s \"tough, no-nonsense investigator\" (To quote the liner notes on the set) has always had an understated sense of humor that has allowed him to smile quitely at the office interaction between the members of the team while presenting his harder face.  But that exterior begins to crack in the \"Kill Ari\" episodes; the mystery surrounding Jethro\\'s background begins to unfold as Ari murders Kate, then takes his shot at Abby and captures Dr. Mallard.  This is what starts leading Jethro to being close to Ziva--maybe no one notices, but because of the information that she uncovered about Jethro and fed to her half-brother Ari, Officer David feels partially responsible for Kate\\'s murder.Through Season 3, we start getting clues to who Jethro is and what he keeps from everyone--the flask that we see at the end of \"Under Covers\", his continued attraction towards redheads (It certainly is no coincidence that Holly/Sheppard is a redhead), and the subtleties of his relationship with Ziva--forged in an oddly shared tragedy.  Of course, much of all that goes on in the season comes to a head in the \"Hiatus\" two-parter at the end of the season.  We find out why Gibbs is what he is, how many of his actions have prepared DiNozzo for running the team and prepped Tim for being an agent; and how the discoveries affect his relationship with Dr. Mallard and Director Sheppard.As always since this series started, the performances are stunning.  Mark Harmon continues to embody the toughness and instincts of Jethro, but also had to be very nuanced as Gibbs\\' painful history comes out.Michael Weatherly\\'s Tony DiNozzo continued being the second coming of David Addison (my usual Moonlighting aside), but Tony had to face growing up and being a decision-maker/leader (\"Bait\"), and had a difficulty through this season that he hadn\\'t had in the previous two--ZIVA.Cote De Pablo flipped the dynamic of the team.  As Ziva, Cote brought a much more formidable presence to the squad.  In the first two seasons, Tony could get Kate off-balance with his remarks and his stunts, offending her Catholic schoolgirl sensibilities.  In the third season, Ziva--partially because of her background, partially because it was just HER--was able to get Tony off his feed more than he thought possible.  An example of this--aside from her driving, or her mangling of slang--came up in \"Probie\", when she was able to get Tony to reveal why he was receiving calls from a sperm bank.  De Pablo was able to affect a very cool and very canny customer in Ziva.  Many viewers are always going to miss Sasha Alexander, but Cote is a wonderful fit.Sean Murray\\'s Tim McGee is still a wonderful work in progress; the nerd-boy field agent who continues to get tortured by DiNozzo in a big-brother/little-brother fashion.  He still seems over his head at times, eager to please Gibbs (Or at least keep Jethro from popping him one in the back of the head--isn\\'t it funny how The Head Slap has become one of the show\\'s many trademarks?).  Plus, there\\'s whatever seems to be going on in his private life, whether or not it\\'s with Abby.Of course, what can be said about Pauley?  Perrette is a scene-stealing wonder on screen, especially in Abby\\'s lab when she\\'s mainlining the \"Kaff-Pow\" or getting Bert to do what he does (Her stuffed hippo--YEAH, THAT ONE).  Plus, we get surprised by Abby\\'s ability with duct tape (\"Frame Up\") and her temper in general (\"Bloodbath\").David McCallum\\'s Dr. Mallard continues to be the second coming of Jonathan Quayle Higgins, though not as prissy as Robin Masters\\' major domo.  Ducky continues to tell his stories while working his was through the cadavers.  Plus, we get another visit from Nina Foch as Ducky\\'s mom late in the season, getting a surreal moment when she\\'s visiting the NCIS HQ.Many people thought the introduction of Jenny Sheppard as fluff.  Given the underlying story of the season, Lauren Holly\\'s character was actually needed.  Jenny became an insight to Gibbs\\' relationship issues and why he stays operating as an investigator--basically, she knows certain things about Jethro that his squad aren\\'t privvy to--though as it turns out, she doesn\\'t know the whole story (Until \"Hiatus\").The good guest shots in this set have to start with Sasha Alexander, and her completion of the Catlin Todd storyline.  Her ghost appearing in various forms to the team members was striking (Of course, her schoolgirl outfit in Tony\\'s vision was typical Tony).  Rudolf Martin\\'s Ari Haswari was brilliant--slick, dangerous, deceptive and unstable.  I found myself regretting Ari\\'s storyline being completed--he could have been Wo Fat to Gibbs\\' McGarrett (Hawaii Five-O reference).  It\\'s always fun when Jessica Steen drops in to trade remarks with Weatherly as Paula Cassidy.  Michael Bellisario\\'s turn as Abby\\'s lab assistant is a comical and dangerous turn.  Finally, we can\\'t forget Muse Watson\\'s introduction in the \"Hiatus\" episodes as Gibbs\\' mentor when he joined NIS, Mike Franks.  Franks\\' amusement at the changes--the female director in particular--are tempered by his having to fill in many of the blanks for Gibbs when Jethro is recovering from amnesia.Ultimately, the season of change that is NCIS Season 3 is a storytelling wonder--full of the humor and action that has been the staple of the series since it\\'s beginning, but also the undercurrent of melancholy that permeates this season.  The loss of Kate really becomes the latest in a series of painful losses for Gibbs--but we never realize it until the end of the season.']\n",

After ten years, this video is a very interesting look at the past, and the promises vs. the reality of what became of the Big Dig project.Ironically, or perhaps prophetically, the film begins by showing a section of new tunnel (at time = 2:06). This is the EXACT LOCATION where (on July 10, 2006) the ceiling collapsed on a car, killing passenger Milena Del Valle. The heavy concrete panels were glued in place with epoxy cement that had not been applied properly. It was ultimately determined that ceiling panels weren\\'t actually needed in that location, so today, the ceiling that appears in the video is no longer there.Such was the theme for most of the Big Dig\\'s design and construction. Too many things were \"never attempted before\",  \"biggest in the world\", \"cutting edge\", and/or other custom-designed or unproven technologies. At the same time, the well-connected engineering and construction contractors deliberately made things more complicated and expensive than necessary, so as to maximize their own profits. One notorious example of this became known as the \"Ginzu Guardrails\". Instead of using industry-standard round pipe hand rails in the tunnels, an engineering contractor ordered custom-designed stainless steel hand rails with sharp vertical edges. Besides being much more expensive, they earned the \"Ginzu\" moniker for their ability to slice through accident victims like a knife! Today, many of the original hand rails have been destroyed in accidents and have not been replaced; other sections have been deliberately removed because they are too dangerous. As was the case for the section of ceiling that collapsed, these hand rails were not really needed at all.Of course, it\\'s not all bad; the I-90 extension to the airport has been a great improvement. The Ted Williams tunnel (a.k.a. the Frozen Head tunnel) was one of the first sections to open and the quality of construction is much better than all of the other tunnel sections that were built later. Unfortunately, most of the tunnels under Boston were built very poorly and most disturbingly of all, were not properly sealed to be watertight. In the winter, the leaking water forms huge icicles and ice patches that require application of large amounts of salt inside the tunnels. The large volume of water; combined with the freeze-thaw cycles and corrosive salt effect; was not something the tunnels were designed for. Consequently, the concrete and steel in the tunnels is deteriorating much more rapidly than expected. In another ill-advised design, the aluminum tunnel ceiling light fixtures were attached with steel brackets. Two dissimilar metals in a moist, corrosive environment are always doomed to corrode, and sure enough, in February 2011 the fixtures began falling into the roadway. (they\\'re now temporarily held in place with plastic tie straps, but must all be replaced) As if the initial construction cost wasn\\'t bad enough, the ongoing maintenance costs of the Big Dig will only get worse as the shoddily constructed sections continue to fall apart.I could go on and on about so many other things, but the bottom line is that the cost of the Big Dig was way more expensive than expected and way more expensive than necessary. So much money was spent on this one project, that there was nothing left for other highway projects in Massachusetts, or for the mass transit projects that were initially promised as mitigation for the environmental effects. For most drivers in Boston, the traffic is just as bad if not worse, but instead of being stuck in traffic on Boston\\'s old elevated Central Artery where at least you had a nice view, now you\\'re stuck in traffic in ugly, filthy, crumbling tunnels.The film ends with another ironic quote at time = 33:03 - \"Nobody in five years or ten years is gonna remember the cost, they\\'re gonna look at this thing and say: \\'what a beautiful job\\' \".It would be laughable, if it weren\\'t so very sad.Note for road geeks: Time = 24:05 has a very old aerial view of the Charles River crossing, showing the original elevated ramps that connected the Upper/Lower deck to the Tobin Bridge. Time = 24:42 shows the City Square tunnel under construction in Charlestown, before the loop ramps and Leverett Connector bridge were built.']\n",

            " ['Warning!  Many spoilers!Additional Warning:  Thanks to Canadian and British television, the final episodes of STARGATE SG-1 have already been shown through much of the world.  The following review is based on having seen everything including the series finale.And so after an amazing ten year run, STARGATE SG-1 comes to a dignified end.  Sorta.  Plans for a couple of TV movies are already in the works, so the plot ends that are left somewhat open at the end of the series will probably be resolved at that time.  It is hard at this point to know what the show\\'s legacy will be.  It never received the critical acclaim that series like FARSCAPE, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, FIREFLY, or even BABYLON 5 received, and one can\\'t point to specific ways that it has altered or molded other Sci-Fi series, but simply being around for a decade is unprecedented in Sci-fi.  Yeah, DR. WHO has been around longer, but its presence has been far more episodic and it has sometimes been prey to a budget smaller than a kids\\' show (though certainly this is not the case for its present incarnation).  It certainly did a number of things right.  The writing remained strong throughout.  The production values were strong from beginning to end.  And if it never scaled the peaks of brilliance of other series it still managed to produce many memorable moments.  Perhaps its legacy is something to be set aside for a decade or so.What is amazing is that the tenth season was a largely successful effort at self-recreation.  Season Nine had been plagued by pregnancy.  Both Amanda Tapping and Claudia Black (and some of the outfits Ms. Black wore in Season Ten reveal that she has fully recovered from having given birth--the highlight of Season Ten might have been the outfit she wore in the high school reunion episode from near the end of the season) had children during that season.  I\\'m a huge fan of kids and having babies, but it doesn\\'t mesh well with making TV shows.  Tapping was missing for the early part of the season and Black for most of the middle.  Both were present for the entirety of Season Ten.  Black\\'s real life pregnancy fed into the plot of Season Ten, with her giving birth to a mystical child who became the super-empowered leader of the Ori.  Adria (played by Monica Baccarin, Inara from FIREFLY) grew into a full-grown woman with overwhelming powers in a matter of weeks.  Throughout the season SG-1 has to struggle against their most powerful foe yet, who nonetheless harbors affection towards her mother, hoping to convert her to a belief in the Ori.What makes Season Ten work for me above all else is Claudia Black as Vala.  Although I have long been a fan of the show, I\\'ve long felt that there was a central problem in the core cast.  Though Richard Dean Anderson\\'s Jack O\\'Neill was ever the wise cracker, there was a lack of genuine humor at the core of the show and despite the implied attraction between O\\'Neill and Samantha Carter, no real romantic chemistry.  But Vala is really, truly funny and a real sex post as well.  And it was brilliant to team her with the wound-too-tight Daniel Jackson rather than Col. Mitchell (which would have been expected, since Black and Ben Browder portrayed what was perhaps THE great romantic couple in all of TV Sci-fi, Aeryn Sun and John Crichton on FARSCAPE).  Vala and Jackson are great together, with the unconventional and free-spirited Vala both appealing to and threatening the Boy Scout Jackson.  As a huge fan of Claudia Black\\'s Aeryn Sun, who was a stern and serious character, it was delightful seeing her be such a goofball on this show.  All in all, her character brought a bit of anarchism that was frequently lacking on the show.  If I have a regret with the series coming to an end, it is in not knowing what happens to her next.  In one of the most endearing touches of the season, the Stargate program only very gradually decides to allow Vala to become a part of the SG-1 team.  The season\\'s opening credits start off with the main four marching through the gate, but the week after she is allowed to join, just as the four start to walk through, Vala scampers up to join them.The main plot for the final season focused on the ongoing struggle against the Ori, a group of ultra religious fanatics.  With religious fundamentalism dominating both domestic and international news, with both Christian fundamentalists in the US trying to force public opinion to conform with their beliefs and Islamic fundamentalists trying to force the rest of Islam to conform with their violent and intolerant readings of the Koran (readings that the vast majority of Muslims do not agree with), nothing could be more relevant than intolerant religious zealots who are willing to kill those who do not agree with them.There were some significant farewells in Season Ten.  Samantha\\'s father, who had seen his life extended several years by accepting a symbiote and becoming a member of the Tok\\'ra, finally did die.  And not only Thor, but also the entirety of the Asgard died as well.Although STARGATE SG-1 was noted for its huge, epic, cliffhanging finales, the series finale was surprisingly subdued and quiet.  But also, I thought, remarkably appropriate.  I\\'m sure there was the temptation of a \"Big Ending,\" but instead they decided to focus instead on a relatively unspectacular, intimate episode in which time is essentially frozen for a few decades.  The main five simply spend some time together, while Vala and Daniel actually live a life of romantic bliss.  Typically, they manage a brilliant scientific solution to their dilemma at the end, with only Teal\\'c retaining any memory of the preceding decades.  As the show ends he smiles bemusedly as Vala and Daniel fall into their bickering ways.  But we know the potential that remains.So, a classic series comes to an end.  It wasn\\'t the best Sci-fi series ever.  It wasn\\'t the most ground breaking.  And it isn\\'t likely to be one of the more influential.  But it was the longest running uninterrupted Sci-fi series in the history of Sci-fi and introduced us to a host of memorable characters.  Yeah, it had some unpleasant quirks.  It used \"Science as Magic\" to such a degree that it almost became a parody of itself.  It reused plots endlessly.  I mean, just how many alternate universe episodes did we really need?  And how many times were there multiple copies of the same character?  (I suspect that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA\\'s refusal to use the same plot device twice or to EVER employ science in magical fashion owes a great deal to the abuse of both by SG-1.)  Still, the show took us to a host of wonderful places, introduced us to some wonderful enemies, and continually managed to entertain and delight.  And we got to know the core group of characters quite well.  Not many shows get ten seasons; even fewer manage ten seasons so well.  The show was starting to seem a bit old by the end, but it managed to do what almost no series ever gets to do:  last ten years and still have something left in the tank at the end.']\n",

            " ['and everything in between during the 10th season of \"Stargate: SG-1\". By the way, this ISN\\'T the end of SG-1 as two direct-to-video TV movies are due in 2008 with stand alone storylines. During the 10th season we get to see the resolution of the conflict between the alliance and the Ori, the end of the Asgardians and the continuing blossoming romance between Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Vala (Claudia Black). The show went through a lot of change during the last three seasons as storylines were wrapped up, new storyarcs developed and new characters such as Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder well known to sci-fi fans from \"Farscape\")and Vala (Claudia Black anther \"Farscape\" alum)providing the show with an additional injection of energy. Beau Bridges came on board adding spark to the show as well. Richard Dean Anderson is missed during the 10th and final season but his spirit is kept very much alive by Browder and Black in their roles. Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge proved to the the strongest link in the chain between the old Stargate and new.The story arc episodes are among the best while some of the stand alone episodes are (with the exception of a few) probably the weakest of the 10th season seeming like filler at times. The stand-alone episodes may or may not appeal to you like those on \"The X-Files\" and \"Farscape\" these episodes stand or fall based on the strength of the plotting and how realistic the wrap up is within 45 minutes. Some episodes as a result are better than others with some abrupt resolutions using the old ex deus machina (represented as help from Stargate Command or other sources sometimes unexpected)where more time could have been devoted to the story expanding it over more than one episode. As a long time \"Farscape\" fan I was happy to tag along after the cast changes and found that if you gave the final two seasons a chance, they were extremely good at the best of times.The show experienced a lot of change during the last three seasons which would make one expect them to be lesser seasons than the previous 7. Nothing could be further from the truth. The new characters were perfect additions to the show adding after the departure of Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack O\\'Neil. The addition of Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry to replace long time cast member Don Davis (Davis\\' character was promoted and he appeared in a couple of episodes during season nine)who played Major General George Hammond and various guest stars (Fred Willard, Robert Picardo a regular on \"Star Trek: Voyager\" started appearing in season 9) helped spruce up the last season of the show. It also helped that the Ori story arc was nicely resolved during the last season as well.The show looks pretty good but there are some digital artifacts evident in the transfers. Most of you won\\'t notice them or care but for those that do keep in mind the amount of information packed on each disc. The 10th season has been packaged in the slimline packaging that was rolled out with season 8. I\\'m sure these will show up on Blu-Ray but the show looks fine here and is well priced.The DVD has commentary tracks for every episode except one (and I suspect that was probably an accident as one episode has TWO commentary tracks. They probably scheduled the wrong episode for the second commentary track), deleted scenes, featurettes in the Director\\'s Series focusing on 1 director for 1 episode of each disc. We also got the usual assortment of photo and production galleries included as well. There is a trailer that for the first of the two Stargate direct-to-video movies \"Stargate SG-1: The Ark of Truth\" (the second one also coming in 2008 is \"Stargate SG-1: Continuum\" involving time travel and reportedly will feature Richard Dean Anderson).The 10th season varies but overall it\\'s a good one that SG-1 fans will enjoy.']\n",

Some of the dialogue is spoken so quickly and mumbled that I found it hard to make out. Some have made a bit much of the Boston accents here. I'm from Massachusetts. Mitchum's accent isn't bad, but it's not fully real. His performance as the small-time crook-turned-rat who fears going back to jail is fine, but it's no Oscar winner. I did like the depiction of early 70s Boston and its suburbs, replete with many of the horrible vintage 60s and 70s Detroit autos of the period. Seeing them again made me shudder. This was based on what was probably George Higgins' best crime novel. I've never read it. Don't expect today's production values with this film. Everything moves a lot more slowly, and many shots needed tighter editing.\"]\n",

Eddie Coyle (Robert Mitchum) is a worn out, two-bit gunrunner. He provides untraceable revolvers when required. He draws the line at machine guns. Eddie is honorable in his way. He loves his family. He\\'s just a low life who isn\\'t all that shrewd. The fix he\\'s in, because he can\\'t take any more jail time, is what this superb Peter Yates\\' movie is all about.\"Look. I\\'m gettin\\' old, y\\'hear?\" Eddie tells a young hood who deals in machine guns. \"I spend most of my life hangin\\' around crummy joints with the punks drinkin\\' the beer, eatin\\' the hash an\\' hot dogs and watchin\\' the other people go off to Florida while I\\'m sweatin\\' how I\\'m goin\\' to pay the plumber. I done time when I stood up but I can\\'t take no more chances. Next time it\\'s goin\\' to be me goin\\' to Florida.\" Now he\\'s facing more prison time for foolishly agreeing to drive a getaway car when he should have asked his friends some questions. He\\'ll do just about anything to cut a deal for no jail time. He\\'s nearly 50. He doesn\\'t want his wife to go on welfare, doesn\\'t want his three kids made fun of because their old man is doing time. He\\'s squeezed by Dave Foley to inform...and Eddie decides he\\'ll rat a little. He\\'s too believing to understand he might be tagged for ratting big time. It\\'s all betrayal, but Eddie doesn\\'t really understand betrayal. All those friends of Eddie\\'s make us wary every time we meet them: Scalise (Alex Rocco), who robs banks, sometimes violently; Jackie (Steve Keats), the dangerous dealer in stolen machine guns; Dillon (Peter Boyle), owner of a low-life bar who knows more about things than Eddie does.The movie looks as hopeless as the Boston weather. It\\'s the cold end of fall, filled with drab, chill days where parking lot asphalt is always wet. We\\'re into Eddie\\'s life in the low lane, where the anchors in the crummy strip malls are a tired Woolworth\\'s and Barbo\\'s Furniture Store. It\\'s a lousy life and it belongs to Eddie Coyle. \"Have a nice day.\"Director Peter Yates sets up scenes -- an exchange of machine guns, a bank robbery, a family held hostage, a stakeout in a commuter train lot, a night on the town -- that are so naturally established that we might miss how skillfully they build the story and show us Eddie\\'s life. We\\'re never sure if things are as hopeless for Eddie as they seem. Yates keeps us on edge, and he adds layers of Eddie Coyle\\'s sad and foolish trust.This is one of Robert Mitchum\\'s best performances. Mitchum still looks like he might be a tough guy, but his Eddie Coyle is a man who has had the force of his life wrung out of him. He\\'s been in the life forever. He does the jobs others ask him to. He doesn\\'t ask very many questions. He\\'s just not smart enough. Mitchum takes all the hard edges off his usual persona and gives us an aging loser whose life is on the skids, and who doesn\\'t understand just how badly off he is.The Criterion release looks just fine. There is a commentary by Peter Yates.']\n",

True, many of his films were not worthy of his talent, but when he did get a good script (e.g. THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, HEAVEN KNOWS MR. ALLISON, CAPE FEAR), his performance was always mesmerizing.Arguably, Mitchum\\'s finest screen performance can be found in THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE (1973), now available on DVD from The Criterion Collection.Directed by Peter Yates, who supplies audio commentary on the disc, the film is set in Boston and casts Mitchum as a small-time felon, a family man facing a 2-5 year sentence on a smuggling conviction.  His only hope of avoiding prison is to give an FBI agent (Richard Jordan) information that will help to bring down some bigger bad guys...like the men who have been on a bank-robbing spree and killed a teller during their last job.Mitchum\\'s problem is that, if he \"rats\" on those guys, his life is not worth a plugged nickel.Peter Boyle co-stars in the picture, playing Mitchum\\'s \"friend,\" a former felon who is now a bartender and also supplies confidential information to the Feds.Adapted from the novel by George V. Higgins by Paul Monash, this is a gritty, first-rate crime drama, shot in almost a semi-documentary style.

            " ['\"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\", adapted from the novel by George V. Higgins, is exemplary of the kind of film noir that was unique to the 1970s. It shares the chaotic noir world with films of the 1940s, but protagonist is fast being rendered irrelevant by a rapidly changing world where even corruption isn\\'t what it used to be, and he knows it. It\\'s fitting, then, that the protagonist should be played by an aging Robert Mitchum, conflicted hero of more than a few films of the classic noir cycle. Eddie Coyle (Robert Mitchum) is a hood who runs guns for the Boston mob. Caught in a recent trucking job set up by his bar-owning friend Dillon (Peter Boyle), Coyle is looking at a probable 3-5 years in prison. He can\\'t afford to do the time, so he considers snitching on his gun supplier to a federal agent, Dave Foley (Richard Jordan), but the feds are more interested in a recent string of bank robberies.Eddie Coyle is a man from another era. He ponders how much and whom he is willing to betray to keep himself out of prison. He paternalistically lectures his young gun supplier (Steven Keats) about how rough the business is and the importance of caution and reliability. Eddie is playing by some old rulebook that is no longer applies. He doesn\\'t realize he\\'s being played by just about everyone. He catches on too late to how the game of cops and robbers is currently conducted. \"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\" was an ironic title for a cynical and depressed era. Made the year the Watergate scandal broke, it\\'s hardly surprising that law enforcement is portrayed as no more ethical than outright criminality. Shot on location in Boston, director Peter Yates\\' style is unadorned but includes a lot of procedure -how guns are obtained and banks robbed- that enhance the film\\'s aura of authenticity.The DVD (Criterion Collection 2009): Spine #475. Bonus features are a Stills Gallery of 22 behind-the-scenes images captioned by director Peter Yates and a feature commentary by Yates, recorded in 2009. This is one of Yates\\' favorite 3 films of the 25 films he directed. He talks about choosing the locations, the cast and performances, including a lot about Mitchum\\'s work on this film, his own \"style of reality and simplicity\", and the filmmaking process. Also included is a booklet featuring an essay by film critic Kent Jones and a 1973 profile of Robert Mitchum from \"Rolling Stone\".']\n",
            " ['\"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\" is a 1970\\'s crime movie, with great dialogue, acting, and intrigue. The movie reminded me of \"The Sopranos\" more than classic film noir. \"Eddie Coyle\" is more realistic and subdued than a lot of noir. It also has a lot of criminals interacting: pulling capers, making deals, and distrusting each other, like some of the criminals in \"The Sopranos\". It\\'s centered more on the interaction of the characters and the story than on action. There are several great scenes, where the dialogue and the acting are engaging, particularly when Robert Mitchum speaks. I\\'ve never been a fan of Robert Mitchum, but here he\\'s excellent, bringing a lot of emotion and weariness to Eddie Coyle. The story is also very good, as we see Eddie struggle to stay out of jail. The DVD is from The Criterion Collection, and looks good. There is a new commentary track from director Peter Yates. I don\\'t think this film will appeal to a wide audience, because it\\'s completely a crime film and nothing else, but fans of crime films might thoroughly enjoy it.

            " [\"As I've said in all my reviews, I love the Stargate shows SG-1 and Atlantis, not so Universe.  I like the way they spun off the whole Atlantis discovery as the foundation for extending SG-1 which was great, but ran it's course and was in decline at the end.  It allowed some new characters, albeit with familiar personalities, along with keeping alive some old favorites with vague tie in's to their ongoing lives as well as bringing Samantha Carter back for a season to head the program (in addition to all her guest appearances).  I think the 3rd season of Atlantis was its best.  I knew from the start it would have a shorter shelf life than SG=1 because the premiss had already been pretty thoroughly explored in SG=1. A whole new universe allowed for some new bad guys, but the SG teams and the predicaments they can get into are finite before they are like plots different show.  I enjoyed their greater familiarity with the ancient technology but being Hyperspace or Warp drives, the technology is simply a backdrop to the episode storyline and seasonal/show ones.  I couldn't have stood waiting as long watching Stargate for them to develop defensive technologies and fight the enemies effectively.  I enjoyed the show and season 3 was at its peak as it was becoming a formula rotated through the seasons by season 4 and season 5 it is hard to get enthused when it begins by them canning a long time character who was well liked by fans and characters, replacing her with someone that I would have enjoyed having run Stargate for two shows and then get eaten by a Raithe no matter how much they tried to make it fun watching him have to change his ways to deal with the realities of being in the field.  The characters had become familiar such that losing main ones was difficult in this season making for some heavy shows, but also began the rotation that made it less upsetting when one was lost.  The only thing that sort of always left me in question was how on Atlantis they dealt with exploring an entire Galaxy with a few SG teams while back in the Milky Way they had a ton.  I realize there were more finite resources in the beginning, but by season 3 they had the huge city fairly up and running and enough trade partners to support a much larger military presence which all things considered I think back home on earth they would have been cranking out as many starships as possible because in the big picture they would need a fleet not a couple of ships.  i know they added on, but over years given the stakes I believe an international governing body would be funding mass production of those things so there was always one by earth, one by Atlantis and others for missions and with force.  It is part of what started to become a little to familiar, the desperate situation with impossible odds solved by a miraculous discovery at the last minute.  Great for a show, or a movie, but when it becomes cyclical it eventually translates to a show formula and the interest just begins to wane.  I did appreciate the writing around the problems they faced were of their own making many times (waking the wraithe early, messing with the replicator programming, genetic experiments on the wraithe to make them human) and the moral questions they raise in parallel with the real world application of genetics.  How much knowledge is to much before we are dabbling in areas we don't have enough seem to be evolved enough to have in our hands as they represent to much power, to much danger.  But for Star Gate fans I think Atlantis was a comfortable spin off that allowed a few more years of enjoyment of their &#34;world&#34; but unlike the Star Trek franchise that dealt with all universes the &#34;world&#34; created via the stargates became to self contained limiting the growth of the plots.  Bottom line is by this season you know what your getting and enjoying it, where in the seasons to come it started to get old and thus the show faded away.  Good, even great for periods, but limited from the start by being set in the present.  Great run while it lasted.\"]\n",

Sure, they appear in a few good episodes, but it didn\\'t seem like the story with respect to them in particular moved at all.Second, killing off Dr. Beckett.  I really liked him.  Maybe I\\'m dating myself a bit here, but he was kind of like Scotty and McCoy rolled together but with a cooler head.  This very lovable character will be missed.Third, rehashing the replicators.  With an entirely new galaxy as our backdrop for this series, why do the replicator thing all over again?  It was original enough on Stargate SG-1, but I was amazed that Atlantis started a story arc with replicators too.  Are they going creatively bankrupt already?Fourth, rehashing old sci-fi standbys, like the \"weird alien thingy or disease that causes loyal comrades to start killing each other\".  Did the original Star Trek do this in the episode \"The Naked Time\" and wasn\\'t it done again by Star Trek Next Generation as the second or third episode in that series?Fifth, bringing back a whole ship full of \"ancients\" just to kill them all off by the end of the two part episode.  So, the \"ancients\" have gone from being a great and mysterious race of humanoids from the past to an expediant plot device.  We can create them and destroy them at will just to get and episode or two.  Couldn\\'t an \"ancient\" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters?  Wouldn\\'t that have been interesting?  They could have helped explore the rest of the city.  Their ship could have been recovered.  There\\'s so much that could have been done with them that wasn\\'t.Sixth, lack of character development.  Tayla could be a full-fledged warrior princess with a rich heritage and tons of wisdom, but she seems little more than a pretty (to say the least) face with a great body who never uses contractions (reminds me of Barbara Eden in I Dream of Jeanie) and tilts her head a lot.  And then there\\'s Ronan the Monotone Macho man who does nothing for me but must appeal to a certain demographic so he\\'s still there.Still, the season ended with a special effects spectacular and a tightly written script that showed just what the Atlantis team is capable of.  And, of course there\\'s the wealth of special features and commentaries that you get as part of the standard package with Stargate franchise DVD sets, and that greatly adds to the value of the set.I haven\\'t seen any of season four.

            " ['Warning!  There are multiple spoilers in the following review!I\\'ve watched STARGATE ATLANTIS from the beginning and have more or less enjoyed it from the start.  I definitely plan on continuing to watch it, but I have some concerns about the show that I\\'m convinced have to be addressed for it to continue to be worth watching.First and foremost, ATLANTIS has always had and continues to have serious cast problems.  They have now had three complete seasons to address these problems and while they have played with it some, most of their decisions have been odd at best.  I really like Joe Flannigan as Sheppard and David Hewlett as Rodney, but beyond that the cast is mainly made up of liabilities.  There was one other actor I liked a lot on the show, Paul McGillion as Beckett, but inexplicably in remaking the cast they chose to kill off one of the few strong characters on the show.  Rachel Luttrell as Teyla is more baffling.  Her character has never been very interesting, but I\\'m not convinced that Luttrell is untalented.  I suspect that for whatever reason the writers have simply not been willing or able to come up with any interesting arcs for her (apart from having an interesting connection to the wraiths, which by and large has been underutilized).  My hope is that they will rethink Teyla and either do both her and us a favor and kill her off, or become more aggressive in writing her character and give her some significant arcs and character development.  Jason Momoa as Ronon, however, is probably a lost cause.  He is perhaps the most wooden actor on television today and they have done virtually nothing of interest with his character.  David Nykl, however, is good as Zelenka.  I always enjoy his scenes with Rodney.  Finally, I really want to like Torri Higginson (not least because she bears a scary resemblance to an ex-girlfriend of mine).  I love shows that feature strong and interesting female characters, but after three years she remains yet another character with whom they\\'ve been unable to do very much.  In her case, however, it appears that the producers have decided to either write her out of the show entirely or reduce her merely to a recurring character.  I will continue to watch and sometimes enjoy STARGATE ATLANTIS, but they really need to do some serious rehabilitation.Some help is on the way.  We know that Amanda Tapping and her character Samantha Carter will be moving over from the cancelled STARGATE SG-1 to become the new head of the Atlantis project.  I think she will bring more strength to the role than Torri Higginson did.  Normally I would also applaud the casting of Jewel Staite as the new base doctor.  I loved her on FIREFLY as Kaylee, but I still regret Beckett\\'s leaving the show.  But I honestly feel that the cast needs several more major changes.  The show has had to rely far too heavily on Sheppard and Rodney.The end of Season Three did, however, leave hope for new and better things.  Atlantis has emerged as the name not of a location that cannot be moved, but of a truly mobile city that can relocate . . . well, to anywhere.  The season ends with the city blasting off into space.  I\\'m anxious to see what happens next.  But whatever they do, I would like to see the show continue the risks it started taking in Season Three.  Killing Beckett was an abominable mistake (especially given that there were some other characters who could have been killed with far greater profit to the show), but it at least started giving the show something that both it and SG-1 have always lacked:  a body count.  The good adventure shows have body counts.  SG-1 had next to none.  The only truly heartbreaking death in ten seasons was when Dr. Frasier was killed.  It is no accident that that the episode in which that occurred was one of the finest in the series\\' run.  If you don\\'t have a body count, you get no sense of danger.  On shows like BUFFY, LOST, and BATTLESTAR GALACTIC they have killed off some important characters.  As a result when a character is in danger you get a degree of danger that you never, ever get on ATLANTIS or SG-1.  Well, at least until they killed off Beckett and at least seriously injured Weir.  I dearly hope they continue doing this in the future.I also hope that we see Season Four taking the stories of the Wraith and the replicators to newer and more complex levels.  The series has had some great moments over the first three seasons, especially when they let situations get really desperate.  Hopefully they will continue to do this.While Season Three frequently left me wanting more due to the weaknesses in the overall cast, there were some great moments.  The season finale (both SG-1 and ATLANTIS have had some fine season enders) was splendid.  And the season featured what may be my favorite episode of the entire series so far in \"Common Ground,\" in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a wraith who is allowed to feed on no one else.  Christopher Heyerdahl has played several wraiths on the series, but in this episode he was allowed to give this particular wraith a dignity and complexity not allowed any other wraith with the exception of Michael.  He gradually drains the life out of Sheppard out of sheer necessity before the two of them, cooperating as human and wraith never have before, manage to escape from the Genii.  Then, in a moment that could lead to interesting plot developments in the future, we discover that the wraiths cannot only drain another creature of life, they can also imbue them with it, and as a sign of comradeship he heals Sheppard.  I want arcs like this one!  On a host of other series some of the most interesting characters have been those who came over from the other side.  On STAR TREK: VOYAGER, we had Seven of Nine; on BUFFY we had Angel, Anya, and Spike; currently on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA we have Sharon Agathon and (possibly) Caprica Six; and on SG-1 we had Teal\\'c.  I think it would be fascinating if they could do something like that with a wraith.So I wait for the beginning of Season Four with some nervousness.  The show has some weaknesses and problems, but they are fixable.  The series has not lost any of its potential.  But until we see how the new city in the air Atlantis works in terms of story and how the new cast changes affect the chemistry we won\\'t know for sure.  One thing is for certain.  Season Four should bear little resemblance to any of the first three seasons.']\n",

            " ['This is by far the best season so far. I kept looking forward for nighttime to watch an episode.One thing I like about this season is that some episodes follow on the previous ones. In other words, many episodes are not standalone. Many viewers do prefer standalone episodes, and producers certainly do. For producers, having standalone episodes means a viewer can jump in and watch the series at anytime during the season. This has the benefit of increasing ratings. For some viewers, standalone episodes are also an advantage since they can watch and enjoy an episode without having seen any other episodes. I, on the other hand, prefer continuity, sort of like 24 Hours. For this reason, I thought this season of Stargate Atlantis to be the best.I do have a few comments about this season:1. Dr. Beckett dies in a very simple plot. I was really very disappointed. Beckett was one of my favorite characters, and I often wished he was given more of a principal role. The writers also did a lousy job in the episode in which he was killed. They could have killed him off in two or three one-hour episodes that followed up on each other, thus adding more suspense and thrill. On the other side of the coin, though, killing off a principal character also means that all characters on the show are susceptible to death--none are superhuman. We know James Bond never dies in his movies. However, next time a character is threatened with death in Stargate Atlantis, we will be glued to our seats, wondering whether he or she will die! `Death in the air\\' makes the episodes more suspenseful.2. The character of Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) has not been developed, and she does not have much to say that is interesting. She is also dressed up in a way to make her look sexy. Shouldn\\'t she be wearing a uniform? Can you imagine a female soldier in Iraq wearing her outfit?3. Jason Momoa as Ronon is another underdeveloped character. Sometimes he is annoying. He also is sparsely dressed, being topless most of the time. Like Teyla, I would imagine he\\'d wear a uniform. Don\\'t they ever get cold?4. Dr. Weir\\'s (Torri Higginson) character is also weak. She should be given more principal roles. There are rumors that she might be replaced in upcoming seasons.5. There is too much Rodney in this season, and this gets to be annoying at times.6. In one episode, a ship full of ancients is found. They reclaim Atlantis, and basically kick out the Stargate team from the city, who all return back to Earth. However, in the second episode they are all killed. That was really bad storytelling. As one reviewer pointed out, couldn\\'t an \"ancient\" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters in latter episodes? They could have helped explore the rest of the city and reveal its many secrets. We could have also known more about the ancients and their culture. Furthermore, their ship could have been recovered and used to fight the Wraiths. There\\'s so much that could have been done with the surviving ancients that wasn\\'t.7. The episode \"Common Ground,\" in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a Wraith was fascinating. We discover that the Wraiths not only drain another creature of life, but can also give life as well. For the first time, a bond is formed between a Wraith and a human. Wraiths are shown to be human after all. Humans hunt and kill prey (animals) in order to survive. Wraiths kill humans because we are prey to them, and they need to feed on us to survive. Viewed in this context, aren\\'t Wraiths and humans the same? It all boils down to survival of the fittest.The season ends with the city blasting off into space. Having lost all power, it just floats in space. I can\\'t wait for season 4!']\n",

The other convicts lives are on the line as well since all of them have been ordered to be killed. They also want Dr. Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies) dead or anyone else who has tried to help Scofield and his brother. To show that these guys aren't messing around, season 1 regular Veronica (Robin Tunney) is killed violenty at the end of the first episode of this season.William Fichtner plays Agent Alexander Mahone who we think just wants to catch them but it later turns out that he has been ordered to kill them. Plus that's not all that makes this guy a threat....he's extremely smart and always seems to know what Scofield's next move is going to be. Which is another thing that makes this season so thrilling. You never really know what this guy is going to do next or who he's going to find next. I was hoping he'd find and kill T-Bag (Robert Knepper) but that sleaze ball makes it through the whole season. I don't wanna see this guy die because Knepper is bad at playing him or anything. I wanna see him die because Knepper is fantastic at making you hate this worthless piece of garbage. He's a rat that kills innocent people and slizzers his way away through most the season.Paul Adelstein as Agent Paul Kellerman is back after Scofield and Burrows. But he makes some important decisions as the season goes on and turns out to be just what they need if they want to clear Burrows' name. So there's a lot of character development going on in this season. There's a lot of running going on this season but since this show has great writing it's always engaging and you never really know what is going to happen next. So it's not just a whole lot of brainless chase scenes through the whole season. It's always exciting and has you at the edge of your seat. Plus there is still some scenes where they are captured and have to figure out how to escape. Hell this season has everything really. It's really a must see!\"]\n",
            " ['The first season of \"Prison Break\" was amazing and it solidified it as one of the best new shows on network television. When it ended, with the escape of 8 of the convicts; I wondered how they would keep the show going. Well, they did it...The 2nd season is different from season 1 in scenery and in story. And, I\\'m going to get this out of the way right now, it\\'s not quite as good as season 1. The first season was smart, suspenseful, and entertaining. Season 2 is suspenseful and entertaining...But not a single episode on here captured the heart-pounding 2nd to last episode of season 1. Still, viewing all these episodes a 2nd time (I watched them all while they were airing); It\\'s still an amazing show. When the show begins; Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) have successfully broken out of Fox River. Along with them are John Abruzzi (Peter Stormare), Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco),David \"Tweener\" Apolskiss (Lane Garrison, who\\'s had a recent run-in with the law himself), Theodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell (Robert Knepper), Benjamin \"C-Note\" Miles Franklin, and Haywire. With the entire world knowing their faces, they \"Fox River 8\" begin running...With new character, F.B.I. man Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) guessing their every move. This season develops the relationship between Michael and Sara, the doctor who aided the cons in their escape, and also makes you feel more for the characters. One amazing aspect of this show is that you actually like the characters and want them to succeed despite their wrongdoings. The best example I have of this is the character T-Bag, a convicted rapist & pedophile who is easily the most dangerous of the bunch. Many viewers of this show have a strong connection to T-Bag and love the character. This is not a result of good writing, but a result of good acting. Robert Knepper plays this character so well, you root for T-Bag to succeed. You don\\'t want to see him killed off or shipped back to prison. The fact that the Emmy awards haven\\'t even acknowledged Knepper is a complete travesty. If this was a movie, Knepper would be nominated for an Oscar. But all the actors are good and with season 2, they\\'ve only got better at playing the roles. They\\'re gotten under their character\\'s skin and have really became them. The chemistry between Miller and Purcell is terrific. You believe that they are actually brothers. Fichtner as Mahone is terrific as well. He has that icy stare and intenseness that John Malkovich has and does an amazing job as the sympathetic F.B.I. agent that you love to hate. Like I said, the show isn\\'t as smart as season 1...There\\'s many episodes where they seemed to make up things as they went along (Michael\\'s tattoo has become a ploy and a plot device. The writer\\'s can make new tattoos appear whenever they wish) and the way they handled the Haywire character could have been better. There were times when they disregarded him for several episodes, when really he should have been caught by episode 3. There\\'s no way that Haywire could\\'ve remained out longer than Abruzzi. But the suspense factor is way up there. Every episode has me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next (Even though, I already knew which makes it even more impressive). If you haven\\'t jumped on the \"Prison Break\" bandwagon yet, you should...I missed the season 3 premiere last night and I truly want to cry, because I can\\'t wait to see what happens next. When you have a TV show that can you get that pumped up, you know you\\'ve found something special...And \"Prison Break\" is damned special all right. Fine acting, terrific writing, and nail-biting suspense. I said this is my review for season 1 a long time ago, but I\\'m going to state it again. If this was a movie, you can bet that Oscars would be involved.GRADE: A']\n",
            " [\"As the second season of Prison Break opens, things get moving along rather quickly.  Michael (Wentworth Miller), Linc (Dominic Purcell), Sucre (Amaury Nolasco), C-Note (Rockmond Dunbar), and John (Peter Stormare) have escaped from prison and are on the run.  After going their seperate ways, shady FBI Agent Mahone (William Fichtner) arrives on the scene with one main intention: stop Michael and Linc from escaping the country.  In the meantime, T-Bag (Robert Knepper) goes to some great lengths to get what he wants, and Captain Bellick (Wade Williams) is still hot on the brothers' trail.  The conspiracy that was apparent in season one is even more farther reaching here, as revelations are made that will cost everyone involved dearly, and by the end of the season, not everyone that has been here since the beginning will still be standing.  What makes Prison Break so good is that the show never relents from it's break neck pacing.  This could easily be a bad thing, but the minds behind Prison Break manage to keep the constant flow stable enough so you never know what to expect next.  Even with the major change of scenery for the main characters, the show stays more compelling than ever as it becomes a high octane game of cat and mouse.  Undoubtedly one of (if not the) best shows on prime time network television today (and on Fox), Prison Break just keeps getting better, and by the end of the season finale, you'll be salivating for more.\"]\n",

            " ['My overriding impression of \"Bones Season 2\" is that perhaps Booth and Brennan were getting too close in season one, and forces needed to be put in place to put some distance between the two. The first was by replacing Jonathan Adams (Dr. Daniel Goodman) with Tamara Taylor (Dr. Camille Saroyan) as Brennan\\'s boss, who, by the way, had a romantic relation with Booth when they were in New York. The second was to introduce a romantic interest for Brennan, in the form of FBI agent Tim Sullivan (Sully), who replaces Booth while he is sidelined for a psychiatric evaluation by the premier guest character on \"Bones\", Gordon, Gordon Wyatt, played by Stephen Fry.Wyatt and Booth have some of the most delicious scenes outside of the episodes where Booth and Brennan get close.In retrospect, it is just a bit hard to take the interchange between Brennan and Saroyan in the first few episodes. Booth is surprised at her arrival, and resists Saroyan\\'s direction. I suppose the reason it\\'s odd is because we all suspect from the outset that in the lab, and with Booth, Brennan will always be the alpha dog. After all, the show is named after her.Overall, I would say season 2 is as good as season 1, and better than season 3 (It is rated better than both seasons 1 and 3.) Season 1 had the \"getting to work together jitters\" and season 2 had the \"separation moves\". The main season 3 arc was simply not as good.']\n",

It's exciting to see a show this good actually stick around for more than a minute.

            " ['O Happy Day! As presented in widescreen, here\\'s Season 2 of Bones. The great news is that there\\'s no slack off at all from season one\\'s most excellent run. Involving forensic conundrums and grim visions of death once again winningly meld with great drama, humor, pathos, and tenuous romance. Emily Deschanel as forensic anthropologst Dr. Temperance \"Bones\" Brennan and David Boreanaz as FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) continue to dazzle as television\\'s most electric investigative duo.Whereas Booth is the intuitive people person, Brennan is still mostly socially in the dark. She remains dispassionate and driven in her pursuit of her personal Holy Grail, the truth. As always, her ability for drawing accurate observations from ruined human remains proves invaluable in solving FBI cases. As ever, the perceptive Booth and her free spirited best friend Angela are her main conduits to understanding the, to her, bewildering labyrinth of emotions and social decorum. Deschanel is great at allowing the audience to glimpse the wounds just beneath Bones\\' supremely confident exterior. She and Boreanaz are magical, and their chemical synergy remains the overwhelming draw of this series.There\\'s a barrage of big technical jargon used on each episode, but that doesn\\'t keep me from being sofa-ed in rapt attention. This show is so clever that my attitude more or less echoes Booth\\'s: \"Keep talking. I\\'ll catch up.\" The mysteries are compelling enough, but when thrown in with the engrossing human elements, it makes me want to tune in to the show that much more. The squints, while intimidatingly brainy and toiling away on a wavelength drastically foreign from that of average folks, are nevertheless engaging and very sympathetic characters. The supporting cast is remarkably good and quirky, bolstered by this season\\'s newcomer Tamara Taylor and by occasional guest stints by Ryan O\\'Neal, Stephen Fry, and the wonderful Patricia Belcher (as no-nonsense attorney Caroline Julian). It must be noted that T.J. Thyne (Hodgins) and Michaela Conlin (Angela) share an endearing chemistry.Season 2 introduces a couple of curve balls, beginning with the arrival of Dr. Camille Saroyan (Taylor) as Brennan\\'s new boss at the Jeffersonian Institute, with whom Bones instantly clashes. Then mix in some office romances (except the one we\\'re hankering for). Offer up a serial killer or two. And, thru all the cases she works on, Bones still fixates on her mother\\'s unsolved murder and her father\\'s disappearance. On this, some light will be shed.My favorite episodes are \"The Truth in the Lye\" (Tub of goo!! So cool tub of goo!! To quote Bones: \"Even for me, this is disgusting.\"), \"The Woman in the Sand\" (Booth goes ultimate fighting and, Omigawd, Bones in a sexy black cocktail dress!), \"Aliens in a Spaceship\" (Hodgins and Brennan are entombed in a car and must come up with makeshift ways to surviva as air runs out; raw-emotioned acting by Thyne and Deschanel), the nerve-wracking \"The Blonde in the Game\" and its equally harrowing follow-up \"The Man in the Cell\" features the return of clever serial killer Howard Epps from last season\\'s \"A Man on Death Row\") and the season-ender \"Stargazer in the Puddle\" (Bones learns more about her mother).Special Features include optional episode commentaries on \"The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House\" (with Emily Deschanel) and on \"Stargazer in a Puddle.\" Boreanaz doesn\\'t commentate this time; perhaps, his effort last season was deemed too loopy. Disc 6 offers \"The Memories in the Season\" featurette; \"Visceral Effects: The Digital Illusions of Bones\" featurette; 8 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by the Executive Producers; and the gag reel.By the way, the episode commentary on \"The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House\" reveals that an unaired 22nd episode will debut in the third season. Does that mean there\\'ll be 23 episodes in season 3? One hopes (but doubts).']\n",
            " [\"This second season is exploring new ways and avenues where bones are of course multiplying at leisure and for our best pleasure. Yet this second season is quite new in several aspects.First and foremost the season is widely open to personal matters and it explores the private, and at times not so private, relations between the members of the team, after the boss has been changed to a woman, which rebalances the sexual ratios. Bones herself is courting and going out with an FBI agent who has temporarily replaced Booth while he was sort of suspended and deprived of a gun after shooting a clown on top of an ice-cream vendor's van. But in the end she will not go through the process completely as far as leaving the Jeffersonian for a life of full leisure and farniente.Zack manages to get his doctorate and to be hired in the job he was holding as an intern because he goes to Angela and begs for help on his  look and manages to become presentable, which means he can now stand in court and testify seriously in a deportment that can carry the agreement of the jury. So far he is no longer obsessed by sexuality but he encounters a great difficulty: he is summoned by the White House to go to Iraq. But this time this reference does not lead to any political dissertation or even cogitation on the subject. Political questions are systematically and carefully avoided in this second season.Jack and Angela are finally realizing they love each other and even decide to get married and they finally find themselves in front of a priest (in fact a black priestess) in some church for the last step when the State Department steps in and reveals Angela is already married in some kind of broom stick over-jumping ceremony. More later, I guess.Booth is entangled in the hands of a British shrink after his shooting the clown on the ice-cream vendor's van and he is a perfect sucker, building a full barbecue for the shrink under the shrink's blackmailing procedure of retaining the document he must sign. This same shrink will also step into Bones' psyche as some kind of private counselor. Agent Booth and Doctor Brennan will not be able to establish some kind of personal relationship, especially since Temperance's father reappears in her life and even saves the situation a couple of times. But he has to be arrested by Booth and be brought to court for his ancient crimes, including the attack against the deputy chief of the FBI, though this one was crooked to the utmost, his lips kissing the heels of his shoes or something like that.Booth reestablishes for a short while a relationship with the new boss of the institute, Dr Camille Saroyan, with whom he had had a liaison some time ago in another life. But that cannot last more than one or two episodes. This is characteristic of all these people: they are unable psychologically or administratively to build balanced and normal relationships. Is it a side effect of their jobs or professions, we can wonder, or simply  personal immaturity?That level of the season blurs out the various crimes and cases they examine and solve. And these cases do not deal with political issues or even with immigration, except one case about some strange Chinese practice of burying the bones of a man with the bones of a woman so that the man has some company on the other side of the road. Most cases are plain simple crimes in America and among Americans. But they often deals with social problems like the mother of a severely handicapped girl: what can the mother do to help her child the genetic victim of a deadly disease that keeps her retarded, even if it is only for a short time before she dies? Some of these questions are crucial: do we have the right to experiment on human beings new treatments that would enable astronauts to reinforce their bones that get highly decalcified due to prolonged sojourn in space?Some of the cases are plain vicious crimes and it is fun to catch the killers who are most of the time not at all the one or the ones we were expecting. Suspense is always with us even if the personal and more sentimental level of this season makes that suspense not as intense as I would personally prefer it to be.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID\"]\n",

Along the way, we will learn that Israeli Mossad Agent Ziva David and acting team leader Tony Dinozzo have secrets from Gibbs.  In the course of the season, we will learn of Abby\\'s secret romance and McGee\\'s secret hobby.  Most importantly, we will learn of Director Shepard\\'s secret vendetta against the arms dealer named Le Grenouille, for which she is prepared to bend and beak rules, and which will place Gibbs\\' team at risk by season\\'s end.\"NCIS: The Fourth Season\" includes eight special features on the production of the show, of which the most entertaining may be a two-part roundtable with the cast.

            " ['Season 4 of NCIS comes off as more a labyrinth than \"The Season Of Secrets\" as CBS promoted it.  The main characters all seem to start in different areas--Gibbs in Mexico, Tony as Team Leader, Tim no longer the \"Probie\", Ziva being Ziva...but as the season rolls on, all the lines start coming together.  Jethro\\'s return from Mexico isn\\'t exactly greeted by Jenny Sheppard, and Ducky Mallard\\'s indifference to Gibbs is puzzling.  Tony is in a serious relationship (Or is he?), and it\\'s driving Ziva to distraction.  Tim has suddenly come into money--lots of it, evidently.  Abby is falling for a little person.  Ducky\\'s assistant Jimmy Palmer is finding himself in a hot affair with the new Probie.And Jenny is running an off-the-books investigation that gets the Christians In Action (Initials, folks) upset at NCIS.It\\'s a complicated season where all the characters undergo some changes; mostly pleasant but some not.  Mark Harmon brings Gibbs back from Mexico a little softer (Though not to the team)--enough to allow himself a relationship.  Michael Weatherly gets to have Tony grow up--some--and have his well-known intrusiveness into his coworker\\'s private lives flipped on him by Ziva.  Cote De Pablo allows the Mossad liason to fall for an ill-fated nuclear inspector in \"Dead Man Walking\", but Ziva starts having \"Tony issues\" that don\\'t slap her in the face until the end of the season.  Pauley Perrette\\'s Abby is as she ever is--the attempt to give up \"Kaff-Pow!!\" was classic.  David McCallum\\'s Ducky allows some hurt to show through in his relationship with Gibbs early in the year.  Brian Dietzen and Liza Lapira\\'s sequences in-and-around the morgue were wonderful asides, and made up for the missing \"head slaps\".But Lauren Holly was most intriguing in this season.  She took a character which some viewers considered cheesecake in Season 3, and gave her a very uneasy edge.  The investigation of La Grenouille seemed legitimate, but as the season went on, Jen\\'s personal stake--and what it could cost NCIS--became apparent.  This led to Sheppard not being cast in a good light through much of the second half of the season.This season also became a good spotlight for many of the recurring characters.  Certainly key to the season were Susanna Thompson--Hollis Mann, the CID investigator who got Gibbs\\' attention--and Scottie Thompson as Jeanne Benoit, the doctor who made DiNozzo settle down.  Joe Spano\\'s usual visits as T.C. Fornell, the FBI agent/friend/rival to Jethro were a delight.  But Muse Watson\\'s Mike Franks--Gibbs\\' team leader when Jethro first joined the then-NIS--was a treat; an old-fashioned type who got things done not within the rules (Wonder where Jethro got that from?).  We lose Jessica Steen\\'s Paula Cassidy in \"Grace Period\", and that\\'s a shame.  But Armand Assante\\'s was insidious and slick as \"The Frog\", and David Dayan Fisher\\'s turn as Trent Kort--the CIA operative in with La Grenouille--is also notable.In it\\'s run, NCIS has always had an ongoing storyline that gets buried in the usual action--the identity of the terroist who infiltrated the MTAC in Season 1, the return of Ari leading to the two words (\"Sorry, Caitlin\") at the end of Season 2, and the uncovering of Jethro\\'s life story in Season 3.  Season 4 becomes about Jenny\\'s  investigation/obsession, and how it affects the whole office.  It is aninteresting and ominous turn in the series.  It does require the viewer to follow along closely, but in the end, all the main characters find themselves at the center of the puzzle.']\n",

            " ['Just about the time that I thought just about every possible variant on the TV cop/detective/crime solving show had been explored by the creative geniuses who provide our nightly broadcast television ration of pap, piddle and trivia -whoa - here came a show that tickled our Sherlock Holmesian/forensic knowledge fancy.  Whoever would have thought that poking around with microscopes and spectrum analyzers and picking up little bits of fluff at a Los Vegas crime scene with a set of tweezers could be interesting? But yes, it was and has continued to be for going on eight seasons now and has given rise to a couple of variants set in New York and Miami. All three of the CSI iterations offer a distinct challenge to a viewer who possesses a decent ration of curiosity about puzzles and mysteries but a very, very low gross-out threshold. CSI season 7 mercifully let up a little on the really gross visualizations and focused a little more on the puzzles. Nothing I watched this season sent me gagging from the room, so either they let up or I have gotten a little more used to maggoty corpses.Three of the special features in this collection focus specifically on episodes which made season 7 stand a little apart. The first is  a `making of\\'  \"Built to Kill\" a two part episode set backstage at the astonishing Cirque d Soliel, another covers  the definitive stunt-casting of all time;  Roger Daltry playing five different guest parts in \"Living Legend\".  And a third extra feature focused on the hunt for the \"miniature\" killer, which continued intermittently all though the season. I found the \"Miniature Murders\" feature to be especially fascinating, as I had built many inch-to-a-foot scale model interiors and buildings. Having a series of perfectly replicated half-inch-to-a-foot murder scenes showing up within hours of a real, full-sized murder offered a puzzle to Grissom and his crew that lasted all season. Very obviously, it would have taken an artisan of miniatures days and weeks to build such a detailed replica, and the feature made it very clear what a challenge it was, even with the resources available to a television studio. Other extras include commentary tracks for seven episodes, and a tour of the real CSI-Las Vegas offices; which, astonishingly enough, are very much more cluttered and not nearly as plush-looking as the series sets.']\n",

It goes without saying that you won\\'t be bored anything or character in Season 7 of CSI as they continue to up their game and keep finding more interesting cases to tackle and underlying stories between the office as a whole.After 7 seasons one would think that CSI would be slipping up or become complacent about its longevity.

Each episode has a little something different to it whether its \"Lab Rats\" where the other workers in the CSI office take a front seat to try and help Grissom solve the mystery behind the miniature killer.

Having said that ...Each season I keep saying the same thing, - this show keeps getting better and better. I feel this show always manages to stay fresh and interesting and I love it more and more with each new season. I can't wait for this release.The first episode in this season is Built To Kill where we are waiting to see more of what we found out in the last episode of season 6 - that Grisolm and Sara had gotten together. My favourite episode is Happenstance where identical twins have been seperately killed and the team try to work out whether the case is related or not. If you want a total recap of each episode then here it goes:Built To Kill 1 - Foul play is suspected when an apparent suicide victim still has the gun in his hand, and a flower delivery woman is found crushed to death in the middle of a Cirque du Soleil performance. (Look for a special appearance from John Mayer.Built To Kill 2 - Grisolm investigates the murder of a rock star, which is complicated by the discovery of a miniature replica of the crime scene at the house. And Catherine tries to determine if she was raped after waking up nude in a seedy hotel.Toe Tags - A group of dead bodies in the Las Vegas morgue get to know each other while CSI tries to solve the crimes that got them there.Fannysmackin' - (another favourite of mine) A gang of street thugs is beating and killing people all over the city. Greg witnesses one of the crimes taking place and becomes a beating victim himself.Double Cross - A lounge singer is found crucified inside a Catholic church, and the church's new pastor fails to disclose that he knows the victim from all the way back to high school.Burn Out - A pedophile arsonist maintains his innocence in the disappearance of two young boys, but he is also willing to help the investigation by giving Grissom insight on the potential kidnapper's mindset.Post Mortem - Greg has his day in court for running over and killing a street gang member right before his own beating, and a second crime scene replica is found--this time after the murder of an elderly woman.Happenstance - CSI investigates the deaths of estranged identical twins: one from a gunshot wound, and one from an apparent suicide. The two deaths do not appear to be related, but are they?Living Legend - (the only boring episode) The team searches for a link between a current string of murders in Las Vegas and a notorious mob boss who disappeared in the 1970s.Loco Motives - Gil finds a third miniature crime-scene replica at a murder site, and CSI tries to find a link between the three otherwise-unrelated murders.Leaving Las Vegas - Catherine tries to link an accused killer to a second similar crime in a small town after he is found not guilty in the first trial, and Gil announces that he is going on sabbatical.Sweet Jane - The C.S.I. team doesn't know what to make of their new member ( Liev Schreiber), who joins them in the hunt for a serial killer, active since the 1970's.Redrum - Keppler proposes that Catherine create a phony crime scene to help catch a murderer, and to keep it secret from the other investigators. However, Nick quickly figures out that something is fishy.Meet Market - The discovery of a badly burned corpse uncovers a plot to illegally harvest bones and tissues, and the death of a middle-aged wife appears to be connected to her relationship with a high-priced male companion.Law Of Gravity - When one Trenton cop is murdered in Las Vegas, a second threatens to expose Keppler's past if he doesn't make the case and the evidence go away.Monster In The Box - Grissom thinks the miniature killer is dead, until he receives another miniature crime scene. However, unlike the others, this one predicts a crime scene that hasn't happened yet.Fallen Idols - A star high school basketball player disappears, and the investigation reveals that he gave an STD to a couple of his classmates.Empty Eyes - Six showgirls who live together are murdered in their home, and Sara is distressed when the final victim dies in her arms. However, she may have left Sara a vital clue that could help her ultimately identify the killer.Big Shots - A death in a drive-by limo shooting and the dragging death of a young woman turn out to be related crimes, and Greg discovers that the brother of the young man he ran over may have been involved.Lab Rats - With Grissom out of his office and all of the detectives out in the field, Hodges and the lab other techs try to discover new clues in the miniature killer case.Ending Happy - A washed-up boxer is found dead at a nearby bordello. There are several suspects, motives, and signs of injury. But the medical examiner is having a hard time figuring out which blow was the actual cause of death.Leapin' Lizzards - CSI discovers that a woman may have been murdered, and her head mounted on a wall as a trophy, because the killer was convinced that she was actually a powerful alien reptile. (Quite a bizzare episode and a bit of a departure from what you're used to seeing on CSI).The Good, The Bad And The Dominatrix - After an unsuccessful attempt on Lady Heather's life, Sara discovers Gil's prior relationship with her. Meanwhile, Nick investigates the death of a woman apparently hit by a taxicab.Living Doll - The miniature killer is ready to strike again, and Sara will be the next victim. Will CSI stop her in time?Throughout the season you see the theme of the miniature killer. It started out slowly and built up speed toward the end. Because of the killer and what he/she has done to Sara, Grisolm ending up blurting out to the others about their relationship. At first the team aren't sure if they heard right or not, but it becomes apparent that they are a couple and that's almost as exciting as working out who's behind these miniatures.If you are a CSI fan, you are bound to love season 7. It truly gets better always and I already can't wait for season 8.\"]\n",

After all if the corrupt cop was going to kill his partner he would be unlikely to do it in Vegas when he\\'s from Trenton. However that\\'s not implausible and he was after all blackmailing Keppler. So  people do things all the time that don\\'t make any sense even bad cops. So even a strained episode of \"CSI\" is still top rate entertainment.Overall the series was at it\\'s peak during this season and the next.The ninth season is excellent too but long time viewers are without three of their favorite characters.  As many posters pointed out this is one of the entire series best seasons and that\\'s true enough because it remains a fascinating show and thankfully there\\'s no techno soundtrack like on later episodes of \"CSI New York\".

As the rest of the season unfolds, Greg (Eric Szmanda) finds himself in a predicament he never foresaw, Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) finds herself playing the role of victim, and when Grissom goes out of town, a shady transfered cop named Keppler (the excellent Liev Schreiber) arrives on the scene; culminating in one of the best storyarcs the series has ever seen.  As the season winds to a close, the CSI's close in on the miniature killer, and the season concludes with one of their lives in jeopardy, and the others desperate to make things right.  Undoubtedly one of the best seasons of the show in it's entire run, the original (and best) C.S.I. remains one of the best crime dramas to ever grace prime time network TV, and the seventh season is a prime example why.\"]\n",

I also wonder about how reliable the technical stuff is, I\\'ve goggled some of the smaller thing (that I thought were cool) and can\\'t find them or they don\\'t pan out. I wouldn\\'t worry about any of that if while I were watching it I had enough emotional involvement to care if one of the characters died but after 3 seasons if a main character was killed off I\\'d just wonder how that would change the shows dynamics.One other thing that drive me a bit crazy is that the show acts like the FBI can\\'t even use the bathroom without \"Charlies\" help. I understand its a tool to show how vital he is but he gets 911 calls and guilt trips from his brother before it\\'s necessary, like at the very beginning of a case.So, while I recommend this show, especially for family viewing and believe it\\'s well above average, I still can\\'t say it\\'s great.']\n",

            " ['This was my intoroduction to sci-fi when I was in 2nd grade.  Certain episodes were so vivid that they etched themselves permanently in my memory.  Upon watching them again, I see how they are also emotionally appealing and surprisingly sophisticated, both in their science and in the lack of \"feel good\" deus ex machina endings that mar so many otherwise excellent Star Trek stories.I think by far the best story of this lot is \"The Man Who was Never Born\", which exudes a kind of timeless anguish.  It still moves me to think of the deformed Landau, who was truly brilliant.  But the \"Architects of Fear\" is also wonderful, with the good man sacrificing himself in vain and communicating his love to his wife from his horribly altered form.  They are both tragedies with grand conceptions behind them, truly unique. \"The Galaxy Being\" and \"The Sixth Finger\" are also deeply affecting and believable in their way.  These are all timeless themes in hard sci-fi, done extremely well.There are some bad episodes too, but overall the good ones are worth the price of admission.  I do not see why some reviewers are angry at the format of splitting season 1 into 2 volumes - it doesn\\'t cost more.Warmly recommended as a piece of TV history that still stands on its own as outstanding hard scifi.']\n",

I\\'d give the shows here 5 stars but 0 stars to MGM for this reissue. Why? Because these are the exact same digital transfers as last time. They haven\\'t been enhanced with any thing AND there are no extras. I\\'d average that out to 2 stars for this set.Don\\'t get me wrong--the first season was terrific for the most part. This set (like the first season set) features the moving \"The Man Who Was Never Born\" with Martin Landau as a scarred victim of a viral holocaust who is given the chance to go back in time and prevent the birth of the man who created his sterile world. Featuring a rich score by the late Domninic Frontiere (among his best), this was \"The Outer Limits\" as its best. Also we get \"The Galaxy Being\" with Cliff Roberson who unwittingly brings an alien creature he has been communicating with from a world made of anti-matter into ours causing destruction and death. David McCallum in \"The Sixth Finger\" about the results of an experiment to push humanity to evolve to the next level but how, in the process, we lose the essence of what makes us human.\"The Zanti Misfits\" like much of Stefano\\'s work provides a neat allegory about human nature. We also get \"The Borderlands\" and many other classic episodes mixed with claptrap like \"Human Factor\" but almost everything here is terrific even if we\\'re only getting half a season at a higher price than before.Why not include a commentary track from surviving actors or David J. Suchow the author on the definitive book on \"The Outer Limits\"? Because MGM is convinced that you\\'ll buy this set and the second one coming out in August AND pay more in the process because they\\'ve split them up. Heck, the least they could have done was got rid of those dreadful dual sided discs. Nope. These are dual sided as well.So what do you get? 16 episodes--half the first season of the series. In August you can get the second half of the first season. I\\'m at a loss here--why release the exact same thing as before only in a different package? The only reason is so that retailers (such as Best Buy) who return things after a limited shelf life will carry this again.

            " ['Dexter Morgan is good at his day job, that of a blood spatter analyst in Miami PD\\'s forensics unit. But he\\'s bloody brilliant at his other job, the one where he gets to murder. Whatever effed up sitch it was that caused Dexter\\'s amnesia regarding his early childhood, it\\'s left him dead inside, an empty shell, a calculating cold fish. He co-exists with something he calls a \"Dark Passenger,\" essentially this urge that compels him to kill and kill. Recognizing the predatory beast inside Dex, his ex-cop foster father, Harry (James Remar), took the boy under his wing, reoriented his twisted appetites to a more productive cause. He instilled in Dex an elaborate code of ethics, taught him to target only other serial killers. He taught Dexter how not to get caught, how to blend in. Dads are awesome. And Dexter has steadfastly abided by the Code of Harry. His kills have been righteous kills.This Showtime adaptation is based on Jeff Lindsay\\'s riveting series of books, and if you haven\\'t read them, well, what\\'s the hold up? Dexter Morgan is so emotionally detached he makes Dr. Temperance Brennan seem positively warm and cuddly. Social cues to which we effortlessly respond are baffling puzzles for him. Perversely, there is something innately likable about Dexter. Michael C. Hall plays him with stunning complexity. It helps that, like in BURN NOTICE, we\\'re privy to his inner musings. Dexter is often humorous and whimsical. The girlfriend (Julie Benz) he pretends to care for doesn\\'t suspect a thing. Even Dexter\\'s jittery, potty-mouthed cop sister, Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), doesn\\'t have an inkling.DEXTER THE FIRST SEASON hooks you in straight away as Dexter finds his bragging rights as Miami\\'s resident monster challenged by an innovative fellow serial killer whom the press eventually dubs the Ice Truck Killer. It\\'s an edgy cat-and-mouse game that would span the entire season and cause Dexter to ask serious questions of himself. The lovely twist is that Dexter accepts the Ice Truck Killer\\'s tauntings with glee, perhaps like calling to like. For Dexter, it\\'s an opportunity to play with someone just like him. Never mind that it\\'s readily apparent that this rival knows everything about Dexter Morgan. Dexter shrugs this off. He\\'s having fun.The Ice Truck Killer\\'s modus operandi is eye-catching. He drains his victims completely of their blood and he freezes the corpses, amputates their limbs to a precise measurement. It\\'s fun - and creepy - watching Dexter try to contain his excitement as each perfect frozen body part surfaces, each bit a gauntlet thrown in Dexter\\'s mug.Most each episode also features a \"serial killer of the week\" motif, some heinous repeat murderer targeted and eventually carved up by Dexter, and these lesser villains are required so that we don\\'t lose faith in Dex as a badasss dude, given his inability to track down the elusive Ice Truck Killer. It\\'s a pretty good supporting cast, too. It wasn\\'t long before I was keen into what these other characters were up to. Jennifer Carpenter is my second favorite actor on this show. She is one sexy, combustible, never-stop-cussing cop chick. But I do question her instincts. She\\'s Miami PD - an ex-Vice, newly minted Homicide Detective - and yet in all these years she hasn\\'t caught a whiff of her adopted brother\\'s true nature? And then she does something else which ends up absolutely mortifying. And then there\\'s Erik King whose angry, loose cannon character, Sgt. Doakes, is the only one who gets the heebie jeebies from Dexter. Doakes bullies Dexter so much, I sort of wish Dexter would just disregard the Code of Harry for once. Except that Dexter remains as cool as the other side of the pillow. He\\'s a monster who\\'s got his priorities straight. You need to not miss this show. It\\'s wicked funny, cleverly written, and terrifically acted (especially by Michael C. Hall). Rife with moral ambivalence, DEXTER rewards its audience with unexpected - and frequently unsettling - moments. And you\\'re hooked before you know it.The DVD set\\'s bonus features:- 2 Audio Commentaries by the Cast & Producers: \"Return to Sender\" (with Jennifer Carpenter, David Zayas, Lauren Velez, and Erik King) and \"Born Free\" (with producers Sara Coleton, Clyde Philips, & Daniel Cerone)- \"The Academy of Blood - A Killer Course\"- \"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation\" - feature on a real-life police investigation in 2001 with particulars on blood spatter analysis- 2 Free Episodes of Showtime\\'s Hit series BROTHERHOOD- A computer-compatible function which allows you to stream two episodes of THE TUDORS, to read the First 2 Chapters of Jeff Lindsay\\'s newest novel DEXTER IN THE DARK, and play the newest CSI Video Game \"CSI: HARD EVIDENCE\"- Cast Biographies']\n",

The Officer adopts the child and takes the opportunity to carefully ingrain in him that he is ONLY to kill others like him...serial killers....who have managed to slip through the system and remain free.  Dexter learns to be one of the best blood spatter experts at the police station.This is extraordinarily interesting as Dexter narrates his inner most thoughts, and we get to learn how a sociopath, with no empathy or understanding of how \"normal\" people feel, navigates through society mimicking how people behave.  That is fascinating.  The acting is dead-on and the writing is crisp and taught.  My ONLY issue with this series is the foul, gutter mouth of Dexter\\'s sister...it is so extreme that it feels like slaps in the face.Really good television.']\n",
            " [\"This concerns only the first season of this series and I know some of the things will not seem right to those who have watched the next seasons. But that is just the point. The first season has characteristics that will change later and the meaning will change too. I will keep within the very limits of that first season. What we gather from the first episodes is that this blood technician working for the Miami PD is the adopted son of a police officer. He was adopted at the age of four by this police officer because he had been traumatized by the killing of his mother with a chain saw by some drug dealers. At once the series insists on the fact that this trauma caused an irreversible damage in the psyche of the child who is fascinated by death and needs killing just like junkies need their drugs. He is addicted to inflicting death to other people. We will only learn quite late in this season who his real father was, after his death actually, so we will never know the man really. We will not be given in this season any detail about the death of the mother beyond what I have said. And all the detail that comes up now and then is always flashbacks in the memory of the child that Dexter was. Dexter recovers that memory little by little just like any child or even adult would do in the case of a traumatic event. His foster father just tried to bring this death impulse of his within some acceptable limits, within a certain code: you can kill but to survive hence you have to kill people who are just plain dirty (I sort of remember this is the code of Anne Rice's vampires). And that's what he has been taught and trained to do. First hide your impulse. Second pick the proper criminals. Third do it so professionally that you can never be suspected. This ideology then is very typical. You can survive any trauma if you know what you are, if you accept what you are and if you find out why you are what your are. When you finally know, then you are clear. The term comes from Hubbard but it is the one that is needed here. It may change later. This concept of clarity is doubled then with the Skinnerian concept of absolute determination of your whole being and future by the mould into which you have been cast in the very first years of your life. In this case, Dexter is a killer because of his trauma that happened when he was four, hence he will be a killer all his life. No one can change that. One can only teach the kid a code, a method, an art to do things along a certain ethical line and not to be caught. That is pessimistic but that is not the main interest of this first season. The main interest is that another serial killer, the Ice Truck Killer, though not being a copy cat, is obviously aiming at this Dexter. And his crimes that are very special in their style, method and delivery are there to titillate Dexter, to chase or bait Dexter into a trap or a corner. Little by little we will learn the connection between the two and that I won't reveal. In the end Dexter will have the upper hand and kill his competitor, along his own method, more or less.  The second interest of this series is how Dexter can keep his secret for himself in his own private life, hiding it from the women he is going along with, from his own sister (foster sister for sure but sister anyway), from his direct colleagues, from his department, etc. It is subtle and difficult and there the actor is doing quite a good job, though the series is more building the meaning with the environment of the character than with the acting of the actor. As usual in American series the actors are rather static and the stage director, the series director and the set designer are building around him or her a composed visual moving environment that builds the meaning of the expression or speech of the actor. Note in this case most of the discourse of the main actor is his own voice over the pictures. He is telling us a story and it is often a commentary of what we can see. The next and essential quality of this series is of course the real artistic and artful suspense that is built in each episode and in the twelve episodes of the season and that lets us absolutely breathless most of the time, even when we finally know who the Ice Truck Killer is, and then the suspense does not go down one iota. In other words this series is so far, first season only, Dionysian, quick, fast, dense, exhilarating, inebriating, intoxicating and many other things of that sort. In one word it is addictive and habit forming. You may, if you have ten hours and a half at your disposal watch the twelve episodes in one go and you will never be bored, tired, de-concentrated. Try it and you will like it I am sure.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID\"]\n",

The idea of Dexter being a sociopath is not exploited to its full potential, IMO.  Too much of the time he blends in so much you forget all about it, then you have to be reminded by forced voice overs and flashbacks.  This is a good DVD set though, I see lots of folks complaining about the transfer.  What can I say, don't spend 50 zillion bucks on your TV/Home theatre and you won't be so disappointed.  For 20 bones you get 12 doses of Dexter, AND two episodes of Brotherhood, and one of The Tudors if you have the time to screw around with the PC feature.

The book is an intense ride within Dexter\\'s mind with a focus on his relationship with his Dark Passenger. The details of his relationships with other humans are not as detailed as in the series.Having said this, I highly recommend both.

I have some very queasy thoughts about why a series this twisted is so popular, but I guess it's just another Clint-type revenge drama where psychopathic violence is justified by (a vaguely) moral imperative; we do need our foreign policy to start somewhere.Hall is even better here than in Six Feet Under, where he was superb. He carries Dexter effortlessly on his shoulders, but one can feel the amount of work and care he's put into this role. It's as impressive as Gandolfini's Tony Soprano, and that's saying a lot.

They can even make me angry because I'm so involved and one of my major characters is affected in some way.  I am attracted to Dexter and repelled by him at the same time.\"]\n",
            " [\"Showtime's creative and terrific series of DEXTER is so fresh and uber-cool that we just have to applaud everyone who works on this awesome cable TV series.It is so rare to watch a television show that rivals or even feels like you are reading a rich novel. Usually they screw it up, whether it be Hollywood big screen adaptations of the Sci-Fi channel - they all usually suck eggs.But not Showtime! They are currently way better than HBO. With the richness of feel and look at the miami-based Dexter, the actors and writers here truly shine above most others of all arenas of television and/or Box Office standards.And the 2nd season thus far is just as good - if not better!\"]\n",
            " ['Television has been called a vast wasteland. I\\'ve heard people rant and rave for years about having so many channels and nothing to watch on TV. And then I started looking at two things. The first was my television watching schedule which has actually begun cutting into my DVD watching schedule (so little time, so much to watch). Then I looked at my shelving unit and noticed the number of TV series collections there. People are wrong. There is plenty good to watch on TV. And DEXTER is an example of it.For those who aren\\'t aware, DEXTER is a series on Showtime, so many of you might not have seen it. If that\\'s the case you\\'re in luck because the series has been released on DVD. While season two has just hit shelves in blu-ray format, the focus here is season one.Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is a forensics blood splatter expert for the Miami police department. His job is to help collect and understand evidence found at the scene of a crime that involves blood and blood splatter patterns. Oh, and on the side, Dexter is a serial killer.Stay with me here because he\\'s not a bad guy really. Well...then again maybe he is. After all he is a murderer multiple times over. The difference is that Dexter only kills bad guys. Dexter kills murderers, pedophiles, arsonists and the like that got off due to some technicality. But he always verifies that they were guilty before taking them out of the picture.Dexter\\'s foster father Harry (James Remar) was a police man who found Dexter at the scene of a crime before adopting him. Harry recognized the killing instinct found in Dexter at an early age so he helped him to channel that, to use rules that he established for Dexter, to get through life. And via Harry\\'s rules, Dexter now kills bad guys using his job as a means to find just the right victims.So there is the basic set up for the series. But it\\'s so much more than that, filled with layer upon layer of subtext and inner meaning that is revealed as the series progresses.Season one focuses first on letting us know who Dexter is and who the surrounding cast of characters involved with him are. First off is his sister Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), a seemingly spastic patrol officer dying to become a homicide detective. Deb\\'s enthusiasm for the job is off set by her self deprecating ways and the giddiness she exhibits for all things.At the stations there are two main characters who affect Dexter. The first is Lt. Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez) his direct supervisor who at times seems to have a personal interest in Dexter. A woman who\\'s made it where she is by hard work, she has a storyline of her own involving police office politics as the series progresses.The second is Sgt. James Doakes (Eric King), Dexter\\'s apparent nemesis. Doakes is a hard boiled cop from top to bottom, a no nonsense sort who wants answer and wants them now. Doakes is constantly badgering Dexter, offering everything from name calling to in your face attitude. One would think that eventually the two of them would reach a point where there wouldn\\'t be room for both of them in Miami. One would think.Along with these major players there is an assortment of cast members in the squad who round out the ensemble in the best way possible. And each gets enough screen time in season one to make them a character to care about. The interaction between them on a personal level comes into play as the layers of Dexter unravel.On the personal side, Dexter actually has a girlfriend. Normal on the outside, but not within. It seems Dexter has taken her as his girlfriend to help appear normal. It is through his thoughts (voice over into Dexter\\'s mind runs throughout the series) concerning her that he lets us know he is devoid of emotion, that he has no feelings. His involvement with her is purely as a means to offer him cover.Rita (Julie Bienz) is a battered wife, or at least she was. Dexter\\'s sister was on call when her ex was arrested. Paul, her ex, was a wife beater extreme and a drug user to boot. Now in prison, he gets release part way into season one and a subplot here involving him trying to reinsert himself into his family\\'s life crosses Dexter\\'s life as well.With characters and plot lines established, you would expect the series to kick off with Dexter showing what he can do. Instead, Dexter finds himself in a competition of sorts when a new serial killer hits Miami. And this killer is leaving calling cards that Dexter not only finds discomforting but amazing as well. He\\'s impressed with the style and artistic ability of the killer who leaves his victims in pieces and drained of blood.As each episode continues the tale, we find that this new killer referred to as the Ice Truck Killer (when it\\'s discovered that he uses one to haul victims from their murder location to where he leaves their bodies) knows something about Dexter. He leaves small clues at first for Dexter to find. Eventually he leaves Polaroid\\'s of Dexter\\'s past as well. It seems that the perfect serial killer is being stalked by his own serial killer.Season one not only defines who the character of Dexter is it offers the world he lives in and tosses in his biggest match to boot. How Dexter became who he is and what influences him is told in flashback. His motivations are shown by the end of this season as is the identity of the Ice Truck Killer. But will that change who Dexter is? Doubtful since season four begins soon.What makes this show so unique is that it combines one of the most frightening characters one can imagine, a soul less who cares serial killer, with one of the wittiest funny line spouting people seen on TV. Dexter tosses off subtle one liners non-stop and each one offers a glimpse behind the mask and a laugh as well.But the amazing thing is that not only do we find ourselves repulsed and attracted to the same character, we find in the writing that there is more to him than is even he realizes. The character of Dexter may think he possesses no emotions whatsoever but his emotions run deeper than he realizes. And it seems as though his journey of self revelation may be what\\'s driving the series forward in later seasons.Also Dexter offers something that many of us would never want to admit we seek. An avenging angel out there doing what so many would love to know is going on but at the same time turn their head and condemn on the outside. Like Jack Bauer of \"24\", a hero who uses tactics we claim to hate while hoping someone like him exists to protect us, Dexter is the privately admired solution for those who feel that the worst of criminals are let lose on technicalities. We would fear someone like Dexter while at the same time would love to see someone who doesn\\'t let the bad guy get away with murder. Even though this is what Dexter does, murder.There is no way to offer up in this short space just what it is that Dexter is about. Police procedural. Police politics. Serial killer. Murder mystery. Family complexities. Killing tutorial. Hilarious dark comedy. All are a part of Dexter and all come together in a fantastic package.If you\\'re not afraid to try something a little different, then you need to give Dexter a try. I know the season one set I watch belonged to my son. After watching I intend to get a copy of my own. And to continue with it down the line. I\\'m already hard at work watching season two on blu-ray to write about. Unusual, quirky, off beat, scary, normal...all are words that define Dexter. And yet none can explain what this series is all about. Watch and see.']\n",

            " ['Wow! I finally watched my very first episode of \"Dexter\" last weekend, and I ended up finishing Season 1 in its entirety within a few days. This is an amazing show about Dexter (Michael C. Hall), a Miami-based forensics experts who also happens to be a serial killer. However, Dexter is a NICE serial killer in that he has a strict moral code that he always adheres to: He only kills people who are violent criminals themselves and deserve to be punished. The first season of \"Dexter\" revolves around another serial killer that\\'s been terrorizing the state of Florida. The Ice Truck Killer has a nasty habit of murdering prostitutes, cutting them up into pieces, and arranging their bodies artfully in very public places. Dexter works with members of the police department, including his adopted sister, Deb (Jennifer Carter), to find the killer. However, Dexter can\\'t help being fascinated by the Ice Truck Killer\\'s meticulous technique. He soon begins communicating with the killer, who seems to have an uncanny connection to Dexter and starts using his murders to trigger painful, repressed memories from Dexter\\'s past.I became hooked on this show very quickly. Hall is amazing as Dexter, who is probably one of the most complex characters in television history. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Carter, Erik King as Sergeant Doakes (the only person who suspects Dexter of any wrongdoing), and James Remar, who portrays Dexter\\'s father in flashbacks. I\\'m not particularly fond of Rita\\'s character (portrayed by Julie Benz). She\\'s incredibly wishy-washy, but I can definitely see why Dexter was drawn to someone with her personality. I also think the whole Ice Truck Killer identity revelation, intriguing as it was, could have been a bit less obvious. (I figured out his real identity and true connection to Dexter right away, so either the story was a bit too predictable or I am just incredibly brilliant.)Overall, though, \"Dexter\" is a very unique and compelling show. I have no idea how the program will manage to surpass its first season, but I can\\'t wait to find out.']\n",
            " [\"I had never seen Dexter before not having showtime but after seeing the show on a regular station I was hooked and ordered the first season,loved it and am waiting for the second season which I ordered to ship. It's definitely addictive. The show is well written you actually like this serial killer\"]\n",
            " [\"Sometimes I find connections to Hollywood in the strangest places.  In the case of Dexter, it was at my day job. Now my office job is not normally the place one associates with a show like Dexter, but it turns out that the sister of the guy I worked with worked on the show. The fact that the show is on Showtime and thus can portray gore and violence as appropriate to the medium (like HBO's Rome, for example) piqued my curiosity. Unfortunately, it took me over a year to actually view season one.  I'm sorry I waited so long.I've done enough research on serial killers (and their fictional cousin, slashers) to know that they're easy to mess up.  And an entire season about a serial killer from the serial killer's perspective is fraught with peril. Fortunately, Dexter hits all the right notes to keep an audience engaged for the entire season.Dexter Mogran (Michael C. Hall) is a serial killer with a cause.  His father, Harry (James Remar) recognized his adopted son's homicidal tendencies and trained him to stalk the most despicable of prey.  These were the lowest of the low, the scum that Harry in his job as a cop saw frequently escape justice.  Dexter became a Final Solution of sorts, eliminating people neatly and efficiently while at the same time fulfilling insatiable desire for bloodshed.  Literally.In his day job, Dexter is a blood spatter analyst.  He works side-by-side with his adopted sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), probably the most annoying character in the show.  And yet, she's annoying on purpose - her frail, waif-like reactions to men and the rigors of her job make her alternately pathetic and vulnerable, feral and misguided.  In short, she needs Dexter's calm, creepy presence. Rounding out the cast is career-climbing Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez), coworkers Angel Batista (David Zayas) and Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee, formerly of the show Chuck) and my favorite character, foul-mouthed Sergeant James Doakes (Erik King).  Doakes is the only person who sees Dexter for what he is, but he can't prove it.Dexter feigns a personal life as well.  He has a girlfriend, Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), whose last relationship was so emotionally scarring that she fears intimacy, which suits Dexter just fine.  Indeed, all of Dexter's life is an act, from the jokes he cracks to the donuts he brings to the pleasantries he exchanges with Rita.  He's a monster masquerading as a person, and the only reason it's not more obvious is because everyone else has more pressing problems.Dexter's job puts him in a unique position to both appreciate the art of the kill and find new victims. Despite his penchant for murdering his victims, Dexter's murders are relatively clean - he drains his victims of blood, hacks the pieces up, and tosses them into the ocean.  And so it goes: find some sleazeball who escaped justice, kidnap him or her, murder, dump the body, repeat. Until one day, another serial killer who seems to know intimate details about Dexter's past begins sending messages through his own unique style of doll-like murders.The ending of season one won't be a shock to observant viewers.  It's not the actual ending that matters but the journey getting there. Dexter's narration is amusing and wry, his cadence just off enough that he comes across as disturbed yet functional. Surprisingly, the show isn't very gory at all.  Dexter would probably be less sympathetic if we were subjected to every grisly detail.  In fact, by cutting away from the most gruesome scenes, Dexter has to remind us that he's one of the bad guys - the Code of Harry is as much the anti-hero's code that we see in a multitude of other crime-fighting shows.  It's a credit to the writers that Dexter is both a monstrous, damaged human being and yet still human.Can't wait for season two!\"]\n",
            " [\"This is the leader of the pack in terms of Showtime's original series. This is the only show they have that I feel can compete with HBO. The acting and writing are amazing, especially Michael C.

You might find it hard to leave until the first season is over.\"]\n",
            " [\"Dexter has finally made his Blu-Ray debut, and the glossy, well-made series looks wonderful in the format.  Besides some relatively small BD-Live features (including seeing the first episode the third season), there really isn't anything here that wasn't on the standard-def version of the Complete First Season, but for Blu-Ray owners who haven't taken the plunge into Dexter's world, this is definitely worth checking out.  Below is my original review for first season.The interesting concept of this Showtime series makes it reason enough to check it out.  Michael C. Hall (Six Feet Under) plays the title character, who works in forensics for the Florida police by day, and is a serial killer at night. Because of his job and upbringing by a police officer foster father (James Remar), Dexter knows how to cover his tracks while wearing his mask of humanity by day.  Slowly though, things start to take a turn when another serial killer with connections to Dexter's own mysterious past rears his head, and soon enough our title character is caught in a bloody game of cat and mouse.  What makes Dexter so good is the approach taken to the theme of the series by the creators and Hall himself.  What could have easily flopped and failed miserably instead evolves episode by episode as we attempt to see what makes Dexter tick.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well to say the least. Julie Benz (the vampiric Darla from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) is superb as Rita: Dexter's rape victim girlfriend whom he keeps around so he doesn't have to bother with sex, HBO's Oz veterans Lauren Velez and David Zayas as fellow cops, and hottie Jennifer Carpenter (whom Hall has recently married, seriously) as Dexter's sister.  Not since Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer has there been an interesting and above all chilling glimpse into the mind of a madman that walks among us.  Spectacular, and definitely worth picking up even if you never caught the show on Showtime during it's first season run.\"]\n",

It took a couple of episodes for me to warm up to the character, but I did.I soon found myself rooting for a serial-killer who works for the cops which, to me anyway, means the writing is pretty good. The setting of post-Miami-Vice Miami is a visually interesting backdrop - although a little too much at times.

Other times, it's about a man who has no feelings but shows emotions like anger, frustration and fear. Oh, and there's the relationship between the main character and his damaged girlfriend. Who he feels is as damaged as he is. Now, I do hope these are not considered spoilers, as they are the central focus of the series it seems. There are more things going on in the series, such as his past relationship with his foster father, he relationship with his foster sister, his relationship with his coworkers etc. At this time, I can see the character developing into a very interesting but bizarre person. And of course the series will follow suit. We hope. After all, I have 6 seasons to watch. Can I recommend this series, sort of. I am not quite certain it is for everyone. It's growing on me though.

            " ['I guess my biggest complaint about DEXTER is that it isn\\'t nasty ENOUGH.  The premise if phenomenal...Dexter is a blood-spatter expert investigating murders by day and a murdered of killers by night.  By channeling his impulses to kill in a \"helpful\" way...he is actually a hero.  I know, I know, anyone who kills is bad...but seriously, the people Dexter knocks off are mostly brutal serial-killers themselves...killers who knock off children and other innocents.  Dexter is doing the world a favor.  And that\\'s the problem...he is so meticulous in who he kills that his dark side is really never more than a naughty wink.  There\\'s no real ethical dilemma for the viewer in rooting for Dexter.But don\\'t get me wrong...the show is a blast nonetheless.  From it\\'s super-saturated Florida colors, to its sly & witty narration, the show is top-notch and very entertaining.  Michael C. Hall is perfect as DEXTER.  While his performance isn\\'t exactly a tour-de-force of evil (like Anthony Hopkins in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, for example)...it is a lovely, inventive performance.  He brings nuance to the role of a guy who has to fake smiling...and because we know he\\'s faking, we\\'re kinda in on the joke.  We can be \"amused\" along with Dexter at his ability to fool most of society into liking him.The only true \"dark side\" to Dexter is his inability to love.  He has a girlfriend, but only to help himself look normal.  He is very good to her and her kids, and the poor girl (damaged from a previous, abusive marriage) just adores Dexter in return.  But he doesn\\'t really have feelings for her, and this colors all their scenes together.  This is the ethical quandary that I wish Dexter\\'s killings also had.The other thing I really like about the show are the flashbacks, showing Dexter being raised and groomed for his work by a very understanding foster father, who happens to be a cop.  James Remar plays this part so well...it\\'s probably the best role this long-time character actor has ever had.  It\\'s a small part, but he brings great strength to it.  And great love and concern for Dexter.  You always hear that parents will do ANYTHING to protect their kids...Remar\\'s character is the ultimate example of this.Also, the opening credits of the show are AWESOME!!  Creepy and clever.So, while the show, to me, isn\\'t perfect (I would prefer it a little darker), it is still HUGELY entertaining, well-acted by its lead and well-filmed for a relatively low budget.  If it sounds like your cup of tea, I think you\\'ll like it a lot.  If the basic premise turns you off...then don\\'t even bother watching!']\n",

Depending on how you look at it, Dexter is either a hero who rids society of reprehensible, murderous villains, or an elusive criminal whose killing rampage must be stopped.

            " [\"A Showtime production, Dexter is an anomaly.  It is a brilliantly written, intriguing, and totally engrossing series, that is seldom predictable.  Besides a compelling storyline, and characters that seem real, what makes the series even more unique, is that the protagonist, Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a blood spatter expert for the Miami police, is a cold blooded murderer.Hall's unusual role is the key to the series, and his performance is a riveting, and captivating character study, that makes Dexter a very hard show to turn away from.  Morgan is guided by the `Code of Harry'.  Harry (James Remar) was Dexter's adoptive father, an ex-cop who recognized that his traumatized son, had homicidal tendencies.  To help him survive, Harry trained Dexter to channel his desire to kill in a 'positive' direction, by instilling the directive to kill only those who truly deserve to die.  This twisted morality is quite bizarre, and makes for fascinating viewing, as Dexter kills ceremoniously.Presumably to contain any spilled blood, plastic sheeting is typically spread all around the area, and Dexter himself is also covered with plastic sheeting.  Victims are taped down naked to a table top face up, helpless and unable to move.  After drawing a blood sample for his collection, Dexter gets to work.  The dead body is chopped into pieces, and the remains placed in trash bags.  Few of the grisly details are actually shown, but the presentation is still pretty chilling.  The series has a wicked sense of humor, as Dexter discusses his thoughts through narration, as he nonchalantly goes about his business, which includes murder.  Harry is dead, but appears frequently, in flashbacks.  Harry's biological daughter Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), also works for the Miami PD in homicide.  She is eager, enthusiastic, loves to swear, and has a problem with authority.The twelve episodes play like a chapters in a book.  Unlike most weekly series, the format does not always involve solving a particular case within the episode.  Instead, the story unfolds broadly and more naturally, with information about Dexter and his past, coming in small bits.  Dexter is dealing with coming to terms with his emotions, or lack thereof, and watching how this affects the evolution of his relationship with his girlfriend Rita (Julie Benz), is fascinating.  Benz's performance is pretty amazing, playing an abused woman trying to start a new relationship.The central underlying story concerns a serial killer known as `Ice Truck Killer', who specializes in neatly slicing up his victim's bodies into bloodless pieces.  The whole concept is diabolically macabre, and well executed.  The killer has taken a special interest in Dexter, and tension and suspense grows more intense, after the killer's identity is revealed with a few episodes left to go.  The killer has an elaborate plan, though he is forced to improvise when the pursuit begins to close in.  As Dexter begins to recall the horrific circumstances surrounding his mother's death, the killer makes his play.  The writing is outstanding, and keeps you off balance.  Approaching the conclusion, things get a little shaky in the turn, but control is reacquired, and Dexter finishes wildly and dramatically, with a stylistic flourish that does not cheat the viewer.Dexter is refreshingly different from most forensic procedurals.  Although dealing with violence and death, there isn't a lot of fighting, shootouts, or chases.  The focus is on character and story development.  While there are things that go over the top, or are illogical, unlike programs like the CSI franchise, the level of drama isn't routinely pumped up by threats, flashy violence, condescending dialog, or music.  The police in Dexter work `normally', with no overly dramatic background music, while routine tasks like, processing the crime scene, performing tests, or analyzing evidence take place.  The level of acting by almost everyone involved is excellent, from the minor characters to the leads.  The writing is not perfect, but the characters and their dialog, are mostly credible, showing the audience some respect.  There are no long winded pretentious speeches sprouting psychobabble, phony overdramatic situations, and characters trying to top each other, or engaging in supercop behavior.  Criminal Minds or CSI Miami, this is not.The series is far from perfect, and doesn't escape being ridiculous.  While a darkened room, draped with plastic sheeting, with a naked victim tapped down helpless, is a terrifying scene, it makes little sense, unless Dexter has giant rolls of plastic sheeting, and maybe a case of packing tape in his car.  The time it would take to actually prepare the scene, and put up all that sheeting would be ridiculous.  Tape and plastic sheeting are excellent for retaining evidence like fingerprints, would have to be destroyed.  Dexter disposes a couple of bags of body parts per kill, but what happens to all that tape and plastic sheeting?  Over the course of the season, Dexter takes chances, makes mistakes, and has several close calls, and is clearly under suspicion, at the conclusion, setting the stage for the next season.One of the few negatives is the lack of subtitles, and the inappropriateness of the extras.  Two episodes have commentary tracks, but some of the other bonus materials, are not directly related to the series.  The mini-documentary Witnessed in Blood, covers the forensics for an unrelated criminal case.  And two episodes of Showtime's series Brotherhood are included, presumably as an attempt to promote that series.  More material specifically relevant to Dexter, would certainly have been preferred.  Otherwise, needless to say, the series is highly recommended to fans of the forensic crime genre.\"]\n",
            " ['I was hooked after the first episode.  I love the concept: a blood splatter expert who seconds as a serial killer that preys upon other serial killers.  Michael C. Hall seems as if he was born to play the role of Dexter.  Every season there seems to be one central character that Dexter must hunt down, amongst various other serial killers and murders that end up getting chopped up on his table.  This season follows Dexter&#8217;s pursuit of the Ice Truck Killer&#8212;a sadistic serial killer that chops bodies into pieces after draining all of their blood.  He&#8217;s named the Ice Truck Killer because it is believed that he drives around in an ice truck before dumping the bodies off.  Great pilot season.  If you have not seen this show, this is definitely one you do not want to miss.']\n",
            " [\"This isn't one of those shows or movies about a serial killer who just does it for fun.  Dexter Morgan targets people very specifically and only those whom he believes have crossed a line or violated one of his standards.  For example, Dex would never molest or kill a child, so he kills a man who has done such things to choir boys.  This is not a defense of Dex, just a clarification.What makes him even more complex is that he did not suffer abuse at the hands of his loving foster parents; he maintains a good relationship with his sister, a cop; he works as a forensic examiner for the police; he fakes emotions as best he can with  his girlfriend and her kids; and feels nothing at all, most of the time, unless it's a sense that he must get rid of someone.Michael C. Hall's performance and voiceover work are very strong. He's stretched out further than he could with his character on the late, great Six Feet Under.\"]\n",
            " ['If you\\'re reading this you either are 1) a fan of the show 2) want to know more about it to see if it will appeal to you. Michael C. Hall (\"Six Feet Under\") plays Dexter a vigilante serial killer. By day Dexter works as a splatter analyst in the police department using blood patterns to help determine exactly how a crime occurred.We have a true anti-hero as the focus of the series--a serial killer who almost seems to have a conscience because he focuses on dealing out justice (and focusing his urges)to those he feels are evil. His father a police officer instilled a code to help him direct his \"urges\" and distinguish between good and evil.Showtime has attempted to improve the quality of their shows and their DVD releases with some mixed results. I found the image quality to be anything but subpar for a DVD. It\\'s a very good transfer. Is it high definition? No, but this isn\\'t an HD-DVD and the quality for a standard DVD is very good although there are some digital compression issues that crop up occasionally.The one complaint I have is simple--no chapter indexing where you can see specific scenes for each episode. Sure you can skip through it by hitting the next button but it\\'s kind of unusual in this day and age for new shows to NOT have this. The second is minor and others have pointed it out--the menu is a very basic design that looks like it could have been done by an amateur.You also have to reset audio for each disc as you watch it for 5.1 as it automatically defaults to 2.o. To be sure many of these are minor points but they do contribute to the enjoyment of the show if handled well.The special features are an improvement over some previous Showtime series but far from perfect. We get two episodes of the excellent Showtime drama \"Brotherhood\". We also get \"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation\" a very good featurette that focuses on splatter analysis and what it reveals about a murder. It ties in to \"Dexter\" because that\\'s what Dexter does for a living on the show and it also helps him to break a number of cases. We also get a commentary track that I haven\\'t listened to yet as well as an online link to watch two episodes of the new Showtime series \"The Tudors\" and a pdf file with the first two chapters of the new Dexter novel. I suspect that \"The Academy of Blood: A Killer Course\" is along with the DEXTER novel excerpt buried in the DVD-Rom portion of the disc. You won\\'t be able to watch it or access it on a regular DVD player which is just plain sloppy as this isn\\'t indicated on the package.We also get biographies for the actors. While the extras here (including two commentary tracks on the set are very good, the show could have used more commentary tracks and the involvement of star Michael C. Hall on at least one of them. Also, the special features really need to be more clearly indicated as to whether they are DVD accessible, PC accessible and where you might find them on the disc.Minor Plot Spoilers:Dexter\\'s father a police officer recognized early on his son\\'s proclivities and tried to give him moral guidence and boundaries so that he can function in our world but, more importantly, use his \"skills\" to hunt down those that prey on others.Dexter is conflicted--he knows that he\\'s not normal and he also knows he doesn\\'t fit in (he has difficulty with emotions having to fake his way through it). He also recognizes what he is and how his father tried to shape him into something \"better\".When he goes toe-to-toe with the Ice Truck Murderer and tries to track down this nasty serial killer he gets a glimpse into his own soul but also recognizes that unlike his evil doppleganger he can choose his actions and not just act on his instincts.END OF PLOT SPOILERS:Overall, Dexter is a terrific show. The second season has also gotten off to a bold start. The first season used the novel DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER as a starting point. For the second season the writers/producers have chosen to depart from the novels which should make for an interesting move. This is a solid set that could be improved with future seasons.']\n",
            " ['\"Dexter\" is built on an intriguing premise: a man with antisocial personality disorder experiences murderous impulses but lives by a code - he can only kill murderers.  Kind of a twisted play on Freud\\'s concept of sublimation.  The series didn\\'t initially appeal to me, but overall I\\'m pleased that I stuck with the first season.  Michael C. Hall plays the titular character, a forensic expert in blood splatter.  He works alongside a group of detectives assigned to some of most brutal Miami murders; one of these cops is Dexter\\'s adopted sister, Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter).  Dexter was adopted as a child by a Miami cop (the now deceased Harry Morgan) who recognized that Dexter was antisocial.  Instead of allowing Dexter to go down the path of juvenile delinquency (and inevitably murder), Harry developed a code for him - you can kill but only under certain circumstances.  Harry also encouraged Dexter to do things to make him seem normal, such as dating, to help him hide his true nature and go undetected.  Most episodes feature Dexter stalking a serial killer, with a season long plot involving Dexter\\'s fascination with the \"Ice Truck Killer.\"The series features excellent writing and direction, which helps make the somewhat unbelievable premise feel realistic.  The acting also is top-notch.  Hall does a nice job of making Dexter charming and likeable (so that we can believe that he can fit in at work and his relationships) while also adding a bit of edge through his lack of true emotion, superficial charm, and violent impulses.  We can sense that evil lurks just below the surface, kept in check only by his adherence to his code.  It\\'s a solid portrayal of an extreme case of antisocial personality disorder, and the series isn\\'t afraid to make its protagonist dark and somewhat frightening.  The supporting cast is also terrific, with C.S. Lee scoring as Vince Masuka, Dexter\\'s lascivious co-worker who is a walking sexual harassment case.  Likewise, Sgt. Doakes (Erik King) helps lighten the mood as the only person who seems to know that Dexter is not the good guy he portrays.  I also enjoy the work of two \"Oz\" veterans - Lauren Velez as Dexter\\'s complicated Lieutenant, and David Zayas as Detective Angel Batista (perhaps Dexter\\'s closest \"friend\").Although I enjoyed the show, there were a few things I disliked about the first season.  Debra\\'s insecurity is highly grating, and the actress gives a twitchy, affected performance.  Dexter\\'s flashbacks to his days with Harry become extremely repetitive and unrealistic after awhile.  The first few episodes were difficult to watch, and Dexter came across as quite brutal; I was ready to give up on the series after these shows, but the character became more \"human\" in subsequent episodes.  Finally, the last two episodes of the season, which focused on the Ice Truck Killer case, were overly melodramatic and lead to a rather unsatisfying ending.  Although I approached the series with some trepidation and found it flawed, there\\'s enough to like about the Season 1 that I plan on watching Season 2 on DVD.']\n",

Achieving his lush lawn was relatively simple using a standard fertilizer spreader.This is an organic fertilizer . Here\\'s a brief review of the two major nutrients in lawn fertilizers:Nitrogen (N)Nitrogen is the most important nutrient in lawn fertilization. It helps grow a dense, thick lawn, by stimulating the grass plant growth, and keeps the grass green. This is the lawn food that is depleted most rapidly, but applying too much can create too much top growth and increase the need for mowing.The vivid,  dark emerald green of a lawn can be easily achieved by applying more nitrogen  (caution:  A lot of flowering plants, like peonies, do not want so much nitrogen).Phosphorus (P):Phosphates on the other hand are helpful to strengthen the root system of your lawn. Too much  run-off and leaching of phosphorus used to fertilize lawns can lead to the excessive build-up of algae and weeds in nearby lakes. For that reason, some areas suggest that you limit phosphates in lawn fertilizers to help preserve the local environment and  pose less of a threat to groundwater.  PHOSPHATES MAY EVEN BE ILLEGAL IN SOME AREAS.Mature lawns will have a lower requirement for phosphates.As this fertilizer has 0% PHOSPHATES, It can be a very helpful fertilizer.

I honestly didn&#8217;t believe these would be something I would use much inside, but since I received a pair for review, I decided to try them out with the oven and stove.The first time I used them was while making Chateaubriand. First, I seared it on all sides on the stovetop in my cast iron skillet. The gloves made it easy to handle the cast iron skillet without fear of being burned while also allowing me to handle utensils easily. My pot holders and oven mitts do fine when I want to handle something hot, but it is clumsy trying to handle a cooking utensil while wearing a fingerless oven mitt and using any utensil while holding a pot holder in the same hand is even worse. The Kuisiware gloves&#8217; individual fingers make it easy to hold the pan while stirring, flipping, or performing any other task without need to remove the gloves between each step.I also used them when I cooked asparagus this weekend. I normally seal the asparagus in heavy duty foil, tented a bit on top, and cook it in the oven. While the foil cools quickly, there is still a good bit of steam that escapes when you first open the foil after the asparagus cooks. This was much easier to do while wearing these gloves.I&#8217;ll be using these gloves for most hot kitchen tasks from now on and highly recommend them.

The gloves have the same silicone bands on both sides--thus either glove will fit either hand.  There\\'s never any need to locate the \"left\" or \"right\" glove if you\\'re in a hurry.  The gloves are machine washable, but should be laid out flat to air dry.The accompanying literature includes the following warning:  \"Do not use the glove when wet.  It loses its heat-resistant properties.  Do not use on oily, greasy or wet surfaces.  Do not expose the glove to open fire.  Even though the aramid fibers protect the glove from catching on fire, to prong its life and prevent any accidents, keep it away from fire.  Do not let small children use the glove to play with fire.\"Disclaimer note:  This review is based on a product supplied to me free of charge for review purposes.

There is even a large hanging loop that tucks inside.These gloves are so much better than any kind of mitt that prevents use of the fingers, pads which don't completely protect the hands, or silicone gloves that don't fit well and also get slippery.

Not only did I find that more comfortable to use, it also made it more efficient &#8211; I could control grasping things easier and could get them off my hands without any problem.The build quality is pretty decent. It&#8217;s all plastic, as expected, but the plastic seems thick enough to stand up to quite a bit of use. I like that the front edge is solid, rather than have &#8220;teeth&#8221; like my other grabbers. I had a much easier time scooping things up with these since there were no gaps for things (mostly twigs and the like) to fall through.They measure 15 inches at the widest point and are about 15 inches long (end to end). The scoop depth is excellent &#8211; it was hard to measure, but I&#8217;d estimate it at about 5 inches deep, which is more than deep enough to hold a lot of whatever it is you&#8217;re picking up. There&#8217;s a slot at the hand end so you can hang them up on a nail in the garage. They also come with a storage bag, which is a nice touch.Zero complaints about these &#8211; it made quick work of picking up a big swath of mulch and debris that got washed out of my planing beds due to a massive rainstorm.In addition to using two of them to grab up leaves and debris, using just one is a great way to speed up smoothing out planting beds or mulch.

Where these have proven to be perfect is I have an interesting population of snakes in my yard as do many Floridians. My visitors include a coral snake that is not aggressive, but one that I do not want to bite me when I am scooping up debris, fronds and shrub trimmings. And there is always a pygmy rattlesnake or two in the yard. These scoops put some distance between my hands and inquiring fangs, and I suspect that when my yard guests see this looming near them when I am scooping up stuff they quickly move somewhere else.Seriously, these are easy to use and can pick up surprisingly large amounts of debris.

ReLeaf Leaf Scoops are much larger, and they are cupped to hold a lot of material at once. The handles are easy to grip, and they are designed to help grasp my hands so they are easier to hold onto.

Their &#34;preferences&#34; are for those that are &#34;flat&#34; rather than a hanging jar, and with a ring-type perch. That said, I wanted something like this to hang from an old planter hanger, and this looked like it would fill the bill.First, I do have a leak, and where it drips, it has attracted wasps. Second, the perch is badly made. It was misshapen when I got it, and though I was able to straighten each one out, they are not at the same distance from each &#34;flower.&#34; In other words, if you have one perch centered under a flower, the next one is off a bit, and the one after that off even more. What's with that? Last, I know that Anna's Hummingbirds weigh only a few grams, but these perches are really flimsy.The only species we have year-round is the Anna's, but April is nesting season. While one would think that this would be when mama is hungriest, it has never been the case for our back yard (this is our 16th year of having feeders). We're lucky to get five or six visits a day, and most of those have been males. This is not a criticism of the feeder. I think it will probably attract them as well as any, though I don't think they'll like the perch. (It's only been up for two days.)IF you hang this where the sun will shine on it, the glass will heat up dramatically, and the nectar will have mold within four days. Considering what nectar (or just sugar) costs today, that will add to the cost of feeding these little guys.I'll leave it hanging for a while, but if the hummers don't like that perch (it's easy to tell), I'll go back to the one it's replacing.

While the trap seems to work it's very shallow, so it dries out quickly in the sun. The other issue is that I change my hummers nectar frequently, and because of how I have them clipped up I have to tip them a bit to remove them, and if there is any water in the ant trap it pours on my head. I prefer the separate ones for this reason, they are deeper and I stay hanging when I remove the feeder for washing.The best upgrade is that they finally put a wide mouth on the glass bottle, now I can fit a normal sized bottle brush inside and refilling is so much easier and no need for a funnel anymore!All in all an excellent choice, you might want to still consider a separate ant trap though.\"]\n",
            " ['I\\'ve used all sorts of hummingbird feeders over the years and I\\'ve probably only 10 or more. The design of this Perky-Pet feeder is really just a duplicate of the standard feeder with all the expected features. This is not, however, to be negative in any way--things become standards because they work. Why re-invent the wheel when you find something that serves its purpose very well?This feeder is easy to fill, though you do feed it by taking off the bottom. I much prefer filling from the top, but that\\'s a very minor issue, you just have to give it a quick flip once you fill it and put the bottom back on. Each of the feeding ports has a built-in bee guard though, to be honest, bees (with this feeder and others) will still try to get some nectar--and sometimes the battles between bees and hummers are kind of exciting. And the top has what they call an \"ant moat\" that prevents ants from getting over the top and getting down to the ports. This feature will only work if you keep the moat filled with water, otherwise, ants can climb right out of it (they are ants after all, they pretty much wander wherever they want.The capacity of the feeder is somewhat minimal, but whether that matters really depends on how many birds you have an how much nectar they eat. If you live in an area that has tons of hummers (like Arizona or Florida) you might want to get a larger capacity feeder. Where I am in New England, as long as I change this and clean it every day or two, it\\'s just fine. Nectar (sugar and water, basically) should be kept fresh anyway because sugar mold forms in old nectar and it is dangerous to the hummingbirds--so, in that respect, smaller is somewhat better, it forces you to clean/refill often.The secret to getting a lot of hummingbirds, I think, is to hang out multiple feeders so that there is less competition, keep the food fresh daily and *wash* the feeders so that the ports run clean, etc. Also, put some red/pink plants nearby to attract the hummingbirds. A big hanging petunia or even an impatient basket will draw them in and help them discover your feeders. Also, keep the feeders close to the house (but not in front of a big picture window--you\\'ll get too many collisions) so that you can watch them. I have my hummingbird feeders right next to a screened porch and the cats are just fascinated.I\\'d say that overall this is a fine basic feeder and while I\\'m certainly not a fan of all Perky-Pet products, this one truly is a five-star feeder.

Third, I like that the yellow centers bulge outward slightly and have a smaller grid than most, which may help prevent ants and other bugs from entering the feeder. The Feeder has an &#34;ant trough&#34; or moat around the top to prevent ants from getting into the feeder, but on a hot day, the water you put in there won't last an hour, so I'm not sure how helpful that feature will be.The Feeder does come with a packet of nectar, but here's a helpful hint for you. Make your own for just pennies. Use 1/4 cup white sugar to 1 cup of hot water, stir until the sugar is dissolved completely, then allow to cool to room temperature.

I'm in there all day every day so I can see clearly what the hummingbirds are up to. They adore this! For the first time ever, one of the females has set herself up at a watch-station in the bush immediately under the feeder and guards it zealously. That's loyalty for you! When she's away the others quickly zip in to grab their share.Yes, we do have others in the yard for the others :).It's very easy to clean and fill. I love how the large mouth means the air bubbles that come up during feeding are small, not large. The older style feeders would scare the hummingbirds temporarily when they burbled. This one doesn't phase them at all.Some reviewers talked about leaking. I have this one on a metal hanger attached to the house, and it's right against the window. So there's no breeze in there at all. It doesn't leak, but it's also not very breezy there. I can report that the other similar model is in the back yard where it is fairly breezy and it doesn't leak either.The ant guard works wonderfully.All in all, we love this, and the hummingbirds love it.

It appears to do its job, but on hot days the water is sure to evaporate quickly and need multiple refills. I actually prefer our large, clear ant moat that we hang above our hummingbird feeders.

However, be mindful of the fact that the sugar water must be changed every five (5) days or so.  Accordingly, you may find that thirty (30) ounces of fluid is more than you need and you may end up pouring most of it out at the end of the week.  An eight (8) or sixteen (16) ounce unit may be a better choice.This model lacks an included hook for hanging.The bottle of this model is not open at each end, it is more difficult to clean than a model with a larger opening at the top.  Perky Pet makes at least one other model which opens on both ends allowing you to clean and fill the glass jar though the larger end. That means that you can use a soapy paper towel (rinse well afterwards with hot water to remove all traces of soap), to clean the bottle rather than having to purchase and use a narrow bottle washer brush.I have four different models, but far prefer the Perky Pet Perky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Top Fill Hummingbird Feeder which has not of the above shortcomings and is a easy to fill and clean.

At first I thought the birds were just feeding like crazy and that\\'s why the levels were going down... then I saw because it was sitting on a picnic table that the entire table was covered in red gooey sugar water and the feeder had a slow drip.

Can\\'t recommend, sorry.ORIGINAL REVIEW:There are lots of great reviews for this feeder already so I\\'m not sure what I can add, but one thing that I didn\\'t cross my mind when I ordered this large feeder... you have to have a LOT of hummers feeding to consume 30 oz of \"nectar\" before it spoils in the sunlight and heat.  Our hummers are very territorial and fight off others in \"their\" backyard so they can have all the flowers and of course this feeder to themselves.  That results in the nectar going down much more slowly than I would have predicted.As others have stated, this is a great design, with a wide mouth opening on the REAL GLASS (yay!!!) container (dishwasher safe, don\\'t worry about a bottle brush as someone else suggested).  The ant moat seems to work and the bright red color attracts those hummers.  The nectar that comes with this is comically small amount... only 8 oz vs 30 oz capacity of the feeder.  You\\'ll want to make your own with sugar and water (google the recipe) and without any food coloring which is bad for the birds (Amazon also sells clear nectar which is becoming the new norm now).One star off for being cheap with the initial supply of nectar, but overall an excellent feeder that seems design to perform and last.Hope this helps.']\n",

With a 30 oz. nectar capacity, this glass hummingbird feeder will assure there's always enough nectar to go around.&#34;...One can never have too many Hummingbird feeders! :)Notes after using the Perky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder with Free Nectar for a couple of weeks:What's not to like about this particular Hummingbird Feeder?First of all, the entire unit is very easy to disassemble and re-assemble. The built in ant moat (red top) and base (with the yellow flower-shaped feeding medallions) screw on/off with ease for cleaning and filling with nectar. The yellow flower medallions fit securely into the feeding base without wobbling or falling out.Cleaning the entire unit is a breeze, and takes very little time -- but, one will need a long bottle-brush (I think Perky-Pet sells these) to reach down into the (glass) nectar holder.The nectar reservoir is made of thick/clear glass, the screw on ant moat/holder and base are made of a very sturdy plastic. The colors are bright and cheery and will probably attract more Hummingbirds -- as opposed to more subdued colors, imo.One fills the nectar reservoir when the unit is upside down, screws on the base and flips unit right side up, then hangs in designated place.  a complimentary packet of  Perky-Pet dry nectar mix is included with this feeder. Easy to mix, and dissolved fast. Just add to 8 oz of water, stir, and pour into feeder. There is no &#34;S&#34; hook included with this feeder for hanging, but there is a place to put one built into the screw on ant moat.  The red cap -- at the top of the unit -- also screws off, providing a flat surface for filling the unit. Nice!A really nice feature, of this particular Hummingbird feeder, is the built in bee guard. Each of the six yellow feeding medallions has a raised center to keep the bees from reaching the nectar. I am hoping it keeps the wasps and hornets away as well -- as I've seen a few sipping nectar from Hummingbird feeders, in the past, that lack this (wonderful) feature. I don't think it will keep the butterflies off, though, as they have very long tongues. *smiles*The ant moat is just a must have, if ya ask Me. Lots of Hummingbird feeders lack this important innovation. Just put plain tap water in it, after hanging the feeder, and let it do its job of keeping the ants away from the nectar, and the Hummingbirds.The feeding station is encircled by sturdy little perches for the little Hummingbirds to rest on as they feed. btw, it is a lot easier to photograph a Hummingbird that is resting on a perch. ijsThe large size, and weight (when filled with nectar), of the Hummingbird feeder, keeps the wind from blowing it back and forth. It is also large enough to be seen from a distance, making it a very nice focal point in the garden or on the patio.*Neighbor-envy... The Hummers flock to my new Perky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder...  *smiles, sips espresso*tip:  this is the nectar recipe I've used for years:  add 1/4 cup of pure cane sugar to 1 cup boiling water -- stir till clear -- let cool -- add to Hummingbird feeder. Change out once a week...Does the Perky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder with Free Nectar sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!

            " [\"Hummingbirds are some of my favorite tweets and as a consequence I've acquired a number of Perky-Pet feeders. One reason I like them is that they're affordable, and I've been able to get replacement parts like bee-guards which have kept my older feeders useful and clean.This current Perky-Pet model, the 209B, is really nice. It's got an ant moat at the top and little rails for the Hummers to rest on all the way around.  One of my favorite features though is the ease of cleaning and filling.  Cleaning is particularly important because while making a mess is just my problem (one that can easily be corrected), an unclean feeder can make the birds sick.The wider mouth glass battle on this unit makes filling and cleaning easy.  The glass bottle also threads into the base like a regular bottle/cap arrangement which has kept leakage to a minimum for me.Cleaning the base is easy as the bottom comes apart in two pieces, and I've found that if you take most of the fuzz off of a Q-tip that you can scrub the inside of the flowers, keeping them clear of debris and slimy buildup.The only downside would be the red dye in the sugar Perky Pet supplies. No one recommends food dye any longer. Use it --if you must-- but then use just regular sugar and water to provide nutrition to the birds.  The formula couldn't be easier. 1-cup cooled-boiled water or bottled water (without fizz or chlorine or additives of any sort) and 1/4-cup white regular sugar.  Mix and serve.This is a HUGE feeder, by the way, and I only fill mine with 1-cup of sugar-water because we don't get that many hummers (unfortunately too near the woods) and in the heat of summer it will go bad in a couple of days.  You might want to do the same too.Happy feeding.\"]\n",

They have many variants in their hummingbird line--some perhaps oriented more toward the humans that hang them than the birds that depend on them--but this one's a winner.  It's more in their classic line (my term, not theirs).  Perky-Pet fiddles with their designs a little bit from year to year.  This year they've widened the mouth of the glass container.  Not only is this easier to fill than previous years, but it's also much easier to clean.  This does mean that you've got to move a little faster when you invert the unit to hang, but the tradeoff is worth it.  There's an ant trap on top (that will dry out in a couple of hours in my climate) and a supposedly bee-resistant flower.  Won't know how well that works until yellow-jacket season arrives.The real test is the birds.  It's the very beginning of hummingbird season in this part of the Rockies, so the birds haven't arrived in numbers.  But it didn't take our first Blackchin more than an hour to find this one.I've only got one complaint and that's the fact that only a small hook is included for hanging.

We saw this feeder and thought that we would give it a try. Here is what we liked:1. This feeder is VERY easy to clean and to fill!! Some feeders are so small that it is difficult to get a brush up into them to keep them clean. This is very important since a sugar solution in sunlight and heat spoils quickly and can make the birds sick.2. The color definitely attracts them. There is NO need to use colored solution and it is actually better not to since the dye is not good for the birds. The bright color of the feeder itself is enough to attract hummingbirds.  Should also note that the amount of nectar included with this will NOT fill the feeder.3. If you have problems with bees or ants, this feeder us setup to help you keep them at bay. The clever trap for ants at the top and the bee guards do a very nice job!!4. This feeder holds more than enough food to be able to supply a large number of birds before you would need to clean it out anyway. We found that if we fill it about 1/3 full, it was enough for the birds to go through most of it before it was time to clean it out. Depending upon the amount of sun and heat, it takes 3 to 6 days for the liquid to start to cloud up and to require replacement. ALWAYS clean your feeder when you change food!!Things that we did not like as much:1. The perch is much better than some of their other styles, but is still sort of a pain to keep aligned. It is really necessary, probably not, but the birds will take advantage of it if it is there.  Being a one piece circle does make it easier to align.2.  This unit is WAY too large, at least in our area.  The hummingbirds in our area do not usually allow others to feed at the same time, thus it takes quite a bit of time to go through the amount of nectar that this unit will hold.  If, however, you happen to live in an area where several will share a feeder at the same time, this may work out for you.All in all, this is very well made product that works as it should. One quick note, any feeder will leak if it is in high winds!!! When the winds were less than 12 mph we did not find any issue with leakage.']\n",
            " ['This is by far the best hummingbird feeder we have in our backyard. Hummingbirds are plenty here in our neighborhood and these birds love this feeder. The glorious red color with yellow flowers are a magnet for hummingbirds. The other two hummingbird feeders that we purchased from local Home-Depot also are from the same company Perky-Pet. They do make nice products. This fairly large size hummingbird is very attractive looking made out of real glass vessel for the nectar. The parts come apart easily to clean the sticky nectar when it dries out. Looks that this will serve its purpose for years to come.Very well made hummingbird feeder.

It is big for a hummingbird feeder and should last a little longer between fillings. The nectar mix seemed pretty standard, but it would be nice, if a company were going to include nectar mix with the feeder, to have enough mix to make enough nectar to fill the feeder.  This extra large 30 ounce container needs more than 8 ounces of nectar, obviously. Including enough mix for at least the first fill of the feeder might encourage the buyer to buy this brand of nectar mix next time. It has not been visited as yet. Alas, the neighbor who bragged about seeing a hummingbird was misled. The sweet little guys returned at last this weekend. I have only seen one, but everyone who feeds these birds knows that they are elusive to view and difficult to photograph, which is my aim, of course! This is a great feeder because it holds more nectar than most and has convenient features to discourage the ants, bees and bugs that try to haunt these feeders. The cute little pool on top discourages the most persistent of ants -- thank heavens.']\n",

The packet of nectar only fills it about 1&#34; after you turn it &#34;right side up&#34; and the juice drains into the base for the hummers.  If you have a lot of hummingbirds and they drink the nectar quickly, this is perfect.  If you don't have a need for a lot of nectar, go to a smaller feeder because it's not good for nectar to be out in the heat for a few days as it will spoil and the hummingbirds will go to another station.\"]\n",

I do have several feeders, and so far this is my favorite.\"]\n",
            " [\"Perky Pet says that this is their best glass hummingbird feeder. That's quite a qualified statement, so it's hard to argue that this is Perky Pet's best glass feeder (as opposed to their other glass feeders, or their other plastic feeders). The glass cylinder gives it a good appearance, and its 30 ounce capacity should supply the needs of all but the most hungry hummingbirds.I didn't have any issues with leaking in the four weeks that I've been using the feeder, as has been mentioned in other reviews. The base comes apart, making cleaning easy, unlike their super-sized 48-ounce feeder that I also tested. The neck of the glass cylinder is a bit narrow, so you will need a bottle brush or some practice with swishing a wettened paper towel or cloth to get the inside surface cleaned. The red plastic cap has a loop for the supplied S-hook, and it can stand inverted on a flat surface so that it can be filled without tipping.This feeder comes with a small packet of nectar concentrate, and I would advise tossing it in the garbage and mix up a fresh batch of nectar by boiling water and mixing four parts water with one part sugar. This is the recipe most recommended by experts, and it skips the unnecessary and possibly harmful red dye. I know that Perky Pet says on the label that it won't hurt the birds, but it's not necessary to have red juice, so why add the dye and take the chance?For a cylinder-style feeder, this is a decent unit. However, I still like the dish-style feeders that are available from Aspects under the name &#34;Hummzinger&#34; here on Amazon. Wild Birds Unlimited sells the same type. These are hands-down the best feeders I've ever used, so while this feeder might be the best glass feeder sold by Perky Pet, it's not the best overall hummingbird feeder in my opinion.Even given that fact, I'm giving this a four-star rating, because it does have some good features and I didn't run into any major issues. I would spend my money on something else, but if this type of feeder appeals to you, I think you will like it.\"]\n",
            " [\"I have a handful of hummingbird feeders in my yard, and I'm always trying out new ones and replacing the ones I don't like. My main complaints about other models are usually cheap-looking plastic construction and/or leaking -- which often go hand in hand, as the plastic ones will warp in the sun and start leaking.This particular feeder is a glass/plastic combo, so not ideal compared to glass/metal, but it's well-built and hasn't leaked so far. The opening is wide, making it easier to fill up (no need for a funnel). It has an ant moat. The perch looks pretty flimsy (plastic) but has held up so far. I'm getting lots of traffic on this feeder, so in that sense it's a winner.The free nectar packet only makes 8 ounces, which isn't even enough to fill up this feeder. Still, nice touch.All in all, this is a very nice hummingbird feeder, though probably not the &#34;best&#34; it claims to be. (Perky-Pet has several models I like better, actually.) I wouldn't hesitate recommending this one, especially if you see it on sale.\"]\n",
            " ['This is a far better design than my previous Perky Pet feeder as all the plastic parts detach from the glass.  The instructions tell you to hand wash with soap and water twice a week.  Being lazy and in order to test it, I ran the whole thing through the dishwasher on the top rack.  The glass was fine.  The perches got a little bendy, I probably will not send that part through again.  Because these things need to be cleaned all the time, and it&#8217;s hard to get into the little crevices in the flowers I wish it was dishwasher safe. However,  een if you have to hand wash, it comes apart easily for cleaning but you will still need a tiny brush to clean out the holes.  I LOVE that you can stand it on end to fill, this is a huge plus, no more trying to hold the feeder in one hand and fill with the other.  The flowers also have a little tube that sticks up on them, this does seem to dissuade the bee&#8217;s, but not stop them altogether.The ant moat is too shallow  to be effective here in New Mexico, after three hours all the water had evaporated.  I hang my feeders from plastic bell shaped hooks (type plastic bell ant guard) anyway because all the water moats I have ever tried dry out too quickly.Within minutes of hanging this feeder  (replacing a Dr. JB&#8217;s feeder) there was a black chinned hummingbird partaking.  My usual standby feeders are the Dr. JB Clean Feeder, because they hold a LOT of nectar ( I have one that holds 80 oz) and they can been thrown in the dishwasher.  However, they are much more expensive than these feeders, more than twice as much.  I had both hanging up for a day and did not notice any difference in which one they chose.  I would post a photo, but it appears that we cannot do that anymore.Here is how I make nectar (that red stuff is not supposed to be good for the hummingbirds and it costs too much).  I use a plastic bottle that juice came in (like cranberry juice) onto which I have sharpied a line which is one quarter of the volume (this makes a sweet solution, you can also do one fifth).  Fill up to that line with sugar.  Add very hot water (not quite boiling) leaving a little air space, the water that comes out of my faucet near my hot water heater is actually hot enough.  Put on the lid and shake.  Faster and easier than boiling up a solution every time.  Store extra in the frig.  You can even run the juice bottle through the dishwasher to clean it between making nectar.']\n",
            " [\"I looked forward to comparing this hummingbird feeder with its bigger tube to the smaller pinch waist model also made by Perky-PetThey both suffered from the same malfunction of their feeding solution somehow disappearing.I switched this one and the other model between two different feeding stations hoping to see which one the birds liked better.After never seeing hummingbirds actually use either one but the liquid mysteriously disappearing, I began to wonder where it was going.I had bought some concentrated refill nectar that you dilute to use after all of the powdered stuff that comes with the feeder had leaked out.This model has 6 feeding holes that are of a simpler design than the 4 fake flower looking holes on the other model.I'm not sure which the hummingbirds would prefer if the feeders could keep the nectar fluid in them..Some of the other reviewers had success with theirs so you might luck out and get one that doesn't leak.I hope you do and get to enjoy watching the birds use it.One thing is for sure, the hummingbirds couldn't possibly drink all of the liquid this thing holds in the short amount of time it was up till it was empty.My best guess is that a squirrel climbs down onto it causing it to tip and let the feeding solution come out the feeding holes or some other type of bird perches on it not realizing their weight is causing it to tip and pour out the nectar solution.\"]\n",

Miracle-Gro makes their soils with a heavy content of peat, rather than composted peat or true organic matter which has broken down into soil or is about to. The content of most MiracleGro soils is about 2/3rds peat and the rest is some organic matter which is not quite broken down, a bit of dark soil (to help color the mix darkly), Vermiculite to help keep it fluffy and chemical plant food.While this mixture is GREAT for container plants (container gardens, house plants, seed trays, etc.) where you have a controlled micro-environment, I feel that in general MiracleGro products are not a good to put into the ground. Bag soils from this company can get too dry in hot weather, the chemical fertilizers included are not organic and tend to kill off naturally active insects and other soil creatures which actually help break down nutrients and make them easier for roots to take up. If you see a MiracleGro garden where someone has been heavily using that product, you'll see a garden where there are few earthworms because the pH is not right and the chemicals make them retreat. As well, once you get trees, shrubs and perennials used to chemical fertilizers, those flora will always depend on them because you've scared off the natural things that help them grow.

The directions are slightly different for raised beds or for individual plants. But basically it ends up being a 50/50 mixed of this garden soil and your top soil.

Now, I'm longing to make some hypertufa planters again, but I live in an apartment that doesn't have a patio or deck and buying and storing huge bags of aggregate is not possible. I also have to be more concerned about making a mess. I have to do things on a smaller scale than I used to.A basic hypertufa recipe is 1:1:1 Portland cement, perlite, and peat moss mixed with about 1 part water. (Vermiculite is sometimes used instead of, or in addition to, the perlite; google hypertufa recipes online.) I was pleased to see that Lowe's has a beginner's hypertufa how-to online that calls for using this 8-quart size of perlite. That makes it easier to make up a small batch of hypertufa without having loads of ingredients left over you have to store. Perlite is very lightweight, so hypertufa pots are lighter in weight as well.This size is going to allow me to indulge my creative side, so I'm happy about that. And if I wind up not doing it after all, I've got what I need to loosen up soil in my pots, which is what most people use perlite for.\"]\n",

            " [\"Perlite (any brand) is designed to improve drainage and aeration in soil.  It's white and lightweight - Using it ensures that your soil will drain better as it adds air pockets.  More air pockets = more root growth.There is no exact science of how much perlite to use with your soil - I would suggest for every 2-3 scoops of soil, you add a scoop of perlite.  If you add more perlite than what I suggest, it's not going to hurt anything, you may simply find that you have to water more frequently since your soil mixture will drain really quickly and may dry out faster.As with all Miracle-Gro products, this Perlite provides a small amount of fertilizer (.07 each of Nitrogen - promotes top growth, Phosphate - promotes healthy roots and Potash - promotes abundant fruits and flowers).  I view the Miracle-Gro fertilizer addition as basically a &#34;starter&#34; fertilizer.  It doesn't eliminate your need to fertilize in the future, it merely provides some of the basic nutrients throughout the 1st few watering; you'll then need to research your plant's nutritional needs and fertilize as  recommended.On a side note, I would strongly suggest that if your order this at Amazon, be VERY careful while opening your box.  Mine fit perfectly in the box (with virtually no extra space) and I nearly nicked the bag with a knife while cutting open the box which would have lead to a HUGE mess.

            " ['I\\'m a believer in the benefits of using perlite. It helps keep soil from compacting, giving roots the best opportunity to thrive. I grow a lot of flowering annuals that I primarily begin from cuttings. Blooming plants add more to my home than any piece of furniture ever could and I love that family and friends love them as gifts.You can find perlite in a range of prices depending on whether it\\'s organic and/or contains nutrients. For the most part, I use the less expensive, non-enriched stuff, about $25 for a 4 cubic foot bag (about 120 US quarts).At $5 for 8 quarts, the same amount of Miracle-Gro\\'s perlite with nutrients would cost around $75. It pays to figure out which stuff to use when.For example, if I am given cuttings or seedlings that still need to establish roots, I like to use the more expensive, nutrient enriched perlite and Miracle Gro is my go-to brand. When it\\'s time to transplant, I use a high quality soil (FoxFarm FX14000 1-1/2-Cubic Feet FoxFarm Ocean Forest Organic Soilis a personal fav) mixed with the cheaper plain old perlite.When I transplant, I transplant into a new container that is not too much bigger than the old one. When I see roots are ready to emerge from the new pot, I transplate it into the next size up. If the plant is going to eventually end up in an 8 gallon container, for example, I will transplant it 3 or 4 times to get it there. I get that doing multiple transplants isn\\'t for everyone, and maybe I\\'m fooling myself, but I believe my plants grow bigger and faster doing it this way.The point of this, regarding perlite, is that the more expensive stuff isn\\'t necessary when transplanting so often. The soil contains all the nutrients needed for the amount of time a plant is in each container. It isn\\'t until I move the plant into the container in which it will eventually bloom and live out its life, that I pop for the more expensive perlite.From that point, I alternate feeding the plant plain water or a mixture of nutrients based on stage of growth (FoxFarm FX14006 1-Quart FoxFarm Grow Big Liquid Concentrate 6-4-4for example). My formula mix is heavy with nitrogen at first to grow the plant big and green and then gets switched up when budding starts and again when flowers bloom. All along, the Miracle-Gro provides any necessary \"back up\" nutrients during the water only feedings. Plus roots stay happy in non-compacting soil.I also do not pop for the more expensive perlite when storing bulbs. Water is what releases the nutrients in enriched perlite. Bulbs are stored dry, so I save the bucks when I can.Miracle-Gro\\'s perlite is my brand for the nutrient enriched. It has proven itself to me year after year, and I stick with what\\'s proven successful.']\n",

It can also be used improve drainage and promote strong root development. You can also use it to store bulbs and root crops by pouring it around them and not packing or watering.The amount you use should depend on the particular plant. With rarer plants, chances are that you can find a website that gives a soil recipe saying how much to use in proportion to anything else. The bag says that this 8 QT bag will fill two eight inch pots, so that should give an idea how much perlite you will get.Miracle-Gro\\'s brand also contains their plant food. Previously it had total Nitrogen is 0.04%, Available phosphate is 0.01% and Soluble potash is 0.06%. The bag I just got lists 0.07% each for all three. Although I\\'ve had very good results with their plant food, I\\'m not sure if there\\'s a big advantage to having it integrated since you could add it on your own and I would recommend having a supply on hand. Nevertheless, it probably couldn\\'t hurt. I say \"probably\" because there are some rare tropical plants and probably others that survive on very little nutrients and can be damaged by additives. Nevertheless, I have used this (previous formula) with Nepenthes Ventrata without any problems, and that\\'s a species that\\'s more sensitive to soil balance and more likely to be harmed by the wrong additives than most common house plants.For more typical houseplants, there should be no worries. Miracle-Gro is a leader in plant food and their website has a lot of helpful information on how to use their various products. The instructions on the bag give steps for use with root cuttings and for storing bulbs and root crops. They don\\'t go into specifics for general use and there are a lot of guidelines from horticulturalists but they tend to vary. But it boils down to taking some perlite and other potting soil and mixing it together.  In most cases, somewhere between 25% and 50% will be appropriate. There are even some who grow things in 100% perlite, but I have found that 20-25% works well for me with house plants and a higher ratio works well for vegetable plants.Previously, this came in a bag that was easy to reseal, with a \"Ziploc\" style closure.

            " [\"Nobody who grows house plants should be without Perlite.  For YEARS I thought this stuff was Styrofoam, but of course its not. Perlite is a type of volcanic rock, that has been heated up until is expands. (The rock pops open like popcorn.) Adding perlite to your soil, keeps it from getting too compacted, as well as aiding in drainage.  Perlite helps to keep oxygen in the soil, and air, which the roots need to stay healthy. The biggest cause of death for a typical house plant isn't lack of water, but overwatering.  Add in lack of drainage to overly watered plants, and you get root rot--fast. Since perlite wont hold moisture, its also good for storing plant bulbs.  People also use it to start cuttings, tho I don't.  MIRACLE GRO perlite has their famous fertilizer added.  The price for this bag is cheap, compared to the box stores, and since its available as an ADD ON purchase, you don't have to worry about added shipping. This is perfect for city plant lovers, who might not live near a home depot type store, or gardening center. (Or who don't have the time to go get it even if they did.)You can save a LOT of money if you just make your own potting soil.  I buy the CHEAP potting soil, a dollar a bag, that's just loam, pure black. That type of potting soil is so dense, that most plants would just drown in the constantly wet, poor draining loam. So, just add about one part perlite, to 3 parts potting soil.  Adding a little bit of vermiculite can make the soil retain water, without getting too dense.  People who spend a lot of money for cactus and palm soils are crazy.  Make your own with one part loam, (or ground up coconut shells), one part perlite, and one part vermiculite.  Maybe throw in a little bit of sand too, for very water intolerant cacti. That mix will give you a fast draining soil,  without retaining too much water, which would quickly kill cacti.Perlite tends to FLOAT TO THE TOP OF YOUR SOIL. Its so light, that when you add water to your potting mix, it floats up thru the loam and vermiculite.  The ONLY solution to that, is to put a thin later of very small pebbles on top of your soil. If you are talking about bonsai plants, you might want to avoid perlite, and use fine sized lava rocks, or turface (baked clay) to keep your soil from compacting. Because even if you DO place pebbles on top of your Perlite soils, you will still get that stuff floating up thru the dirt.\"]\n",

Keep in mind that the NPK composition of growth medium and soil cannot be directly compared to that of fertilizer additives, which are a lot more concentrated so they can be diluted in the soil.)The main ingredient is listed as 85-95% sphagnum peat moss, and my bag appears to be about 95%, with few twigs, and just a bit of perlite. The package says it also includes a wetting agent (to help soak in water), along with the light fertilizer listed above.\"]\n",
            " [\"This seed starting potting mix had a nice, fluffy texture when I took it from the bag. It absorbed a LOT of water and held onto it for well over 24 hours, so keeping my seeds moist was easy. The bag didn't seem to go far because the fluffy &#34;soil&#34; compressed quite a lot in the pots, but it isn't terribly expensive so it is still a good value. Germination was less than 60% and I expected better because I used absolutely fresh seeds. The germination failures may have been the result of other factors, so I can't confidently attribute them to this mix. I discovered that my heating pad was running a little high for a couple of days. I have remedied that now and my results on the second batch of seedlings will be available in a few days. I will update soon.The problems with gnats or other small insects and damping off that plagued last year's mix according to old reviews on the prior listing did not occur with this bag.This may be a 5-star product, but I won't upgrade my rating until I'm certain that the germination problem came from elsewhere. At this point, I give a moderately enthusiastic recommendation.\"]\n",

I just step back, sip a hot cup-a-something and watch that seed grow.Okay, so I may have painted a slightly unrealistic picture.

Super heavy duty, well made with solid construction. Easy to attach to the house and attractive, especially since my house has green trim. I use my hose all over the yard, about 180 degrees around and it was always hard for me to yank it over to where I need it. I love that this reel swivels around but locks if I want. Now, it's really easy and enjoyable to water my plants. Also, the little shelf on top really came in handy so I don't lose little odds and ends when I'm working in outside.

            " [\"A nice garden hose reel that's built for both quality and some attractiveness.  While this is fairly heavy-duty, I found that using &#34;light duty&#34; or &#34;medium duty&#34; hoses worked best, as the heavy duty variety don't like to bend in quite a small of a diameter as this gives.  As long as your hose isn't rigid as some heavy duty ones are, you should be able to reel it up easily.Assembly:  it was easy, but the little wrench thing that's included didn't even fit the nuts.  At least the manual even suggests you may need to use your own pliers.Overall, this looks nice, is solid, and based on limited usage thus far, is a quality product.  It would've been nice if it would have some with mounting hardware (come on, it's four screws and you're charging over 100 bucks...); I'm not convinced, even after having this, that I would buy it again based on price alone.  Good unit, but feels pricey compared to other options.\"]\n",

Over the year we've own expensive ones that looked great but wore out far too fast, cheap ones that we planned to toss after each year but which performed so badly we still didn't get out money's worth, moderate ones that seemed to be the worst of all possible worlds...too expensive to toss out and inferior in almost every way. We store one hose in a hose bucket/basket which is less unsightly but still a pain to wind. We have a couple portable reels that are more trouble than they are worth. When this came up for review I thought 'what the heck'....so very glad to try this out!First, this is smartly designed. Really like the added shelf to store accessories which often end up in the shed and out of reach or laying in windowsills. Next, the heft and weight are much more substantial than most...combined with a powder coating, this FEELs far superior to most hose reels.Size is terrific - holds ample hose length for the average homeowner. Function is superb - easy to use handle that is ergonomically stable PLUS (and this is a big one) a built-in swivel so the hose goes where you need it to go with less effort.Stable - you will need to secure this to the house or other designated area but comes complete with brackets.

            " ['May 20, 2014 UpdateI see my review of this product has received no positive and one negative opinions so far. It is my experience that people tend to like positive reviews more than negative reviews. But I count on consumer comments here on Amazon and I want to know what\\'s good and perhaps not so good when I buy an item. Not being shy I\\'ll add to my review with a little more detail.We have now used this hose reel daily for over a month. In general this is a decent hose reel but I have one issue with it. It is a little hard to crank.If you are a young strong person this will not be an issue for you. I am 67 years old and I feel as if I\\'m working out at the gym when I roll the hose up with this Liberty Garden 710. I believe this is due to two design characteristics.1) The reel itself has a little tension. There is a tension adjust screw which I have backed out all the way, and even have tried removing the tension adjust screw altogether. Perhaps other copies of this reel don\\'t have as much tension. It isn\\'t really tight. It\\'s just enough not to be free wheeling.2) The length of the handle bar, which connects the handle to the center of the hose reel, is a bit short which provides less leverage than would be comfortable for my wife and I. The handle doesn\\'t even extend to the outer edge of the reel. There is plenty of room for a longer handle if Liberty wants to make a design change.As a comparison we have a different hose reel in our front yard. That reel (mentioned below) has zero tension on it with the lock off. Also the handle is mounted on the outer edge of the reel (and that unit has a larger reel diameter) so there is quite a bit more leverage. We find that unit easy to use.So if you don\\'t mind the effort required to use this Liberty Garden 710 then you should be pleased with it. However if you\\'re like my wife and I you may find this just a bit too much effort to use on a daily basis. We have 75\\' of 5/8\" hose on this reel. We pull it out daily to water flowers in our typical 100+ degree low humidity weather. When we roll the hose up we aren\\'t rolling up with the whole 75\\' being pulled by the reel. We normally only pull out about 50 feet of hose, then, when we\\'re done watering, we double back to the reel with the hose end in our hand. So we are only pulling 25 feet of hose at most.March 22 updateI did install the reel today. I am concerned about it\\'s use for three reasons.1) It is stiff to wind up the hose. That may improve with time.2) Compared to the plastic reel it replaced (that failed) it protrudes much further from the wall which puts more tension on the bracket. I\\'m afraid it is going to pull out from the wall. If it does it will be my fault for not using more substantial hardware to install it I guess.3) As I said earlier it has no lock to hold the hose in place when it is reeled in. Perhaps the design makes the hose stiff to reel in so it won\\'t turn too freely, presumably then not requiring a lock.It is my wife, the gardener, who will have the final say. I will leave this review at 4 stars so far as these are just my concerns. Actual use may be better than my first impressions.We have an Eley / Rapid Reel Wall Mount Garden Hose Reel Model 1041 in the front yard which we are very pleased with. If this Liberty doesn\\'t work out we will buy a second Eley.Eley / Rapid Reel Wall Mount Garden Hose Reel Model 1041ORIGINAL REVIEW...We\\'ve had a cheap plastic hose reel in our back yard for about a year. It has worked well but sometimes the whole reel pops off, due to a faulty latch design, and sprays water everywhere. When Amazon offered this Liberty 710 free as part of the Amazon Vine program I snatched it up as a replacement for our cheap plastic reel.Upon opening the box I was pleased by two things about the Liberty 710.1) The entire hose reel consists of two main parts, a handle to be installed, Two screws and nuts, and a leader hose. I really appreciate the design which resulted in very view parts to deal with. The shelf part is installed on a wall without having the weight of the hose reel itself attached. Then attaching the reel is accomplished by simply sliding it into slots on the shelf, then using two screws to hold it in place. The instructions, clear with ample drawings, are easy to understand and follow.2) The materials and construction are of good quality. I wasn\\'t expecting the smoothness of the power coat finish. The steel material seems to be heavy enough last a long time, while not being so heavy as to be difficult to handle. The included leader hose seems to be sturdy with brass fittings.One major concern is there is no lock to keep the reel from turning when the hose is stored. Ideally one would approach the reel, unlock the reel, and pull the hose out for use. Then when finished one would turn the handle to roll up the hose, followed by locking the reel. There is no such lock on the Liberty 710. There is a tension screw but that means if you apply sufficient tension to keep the reel from spinning then it would also be resistant to pulling the hose off the reel for use.Another concern is rust if and when the powder coat is scrapped to the metal level. A substantial aluminum design would be my preference. At least a power coat is superior to a spray paint coating.']\n",
            " [\"This is a great garden hose reel--attractive design, well-crafted and sturdy, and with the added functionality of rotation so that you are never kinking your hose. It comes with a piece of hose that attaches directly to your hydrant, so that the water travels through it and into a contacting tube made into the reel itself before entering your actual hose pipe. Therefore this isn't just a reel that does nothing but hold your hosepipe, it actually becomes part of the hose pipe and makes it easier to use. It's a great product.However, I was amazed by the weight of it. We really had to make sure it was securely fastened to the wall for me to feel comfortable tugging on the hose pipe even a little bit. If you think of the weight of the product itself (23 pounds) plus the weight of the hose pipe that you will have hanging on it, then that makes for one very heavy item hanging on your wall. Think closely about what wall you will be able to hang this on prior to your purchase. We ended up using an extra board underneath the bracket just to give it some extra support.\"]\n",
            " ['Amazon shipped fast, arrived on time, good job. The Liberty Garden 710 Navigator Garden Hose Reel is definitely an upgrade up from my old plastic reel system, which I really loved as well since it lasted for 12 years or so. Installation was a bit tricky, but I reeled through it (pun intended). I bought a new hose to use with it that was much shorter than my old hose, and more flexible, and in the long run I think this was a great decision on my hand and future buyers should do. I like the little shelf on top as well, as I place my other hose accessories on it, as well as my watering can. Yes, it has no lock and will droop unless you place the hose nozzle up top, but that is no biggie. Overall, I see this lasting many years, and its a great investment at the price level, so I recommend it to all.']\n",
            " [\"I had the Liberty Garden Wall Mounted Hose Reel Antique Finish 704 on the wall prior to installing this one. I moved the 704 to the rear hose bibb on my house and mounted this 710 model one to the front. I needed to be able to rotate the hose reel 90 degrees toward the driveway.Let me say that the 704 model has been my favorite hose reel ever. I had gotten so tired of those plastic reels that go on the ground, then I went thru a plastic reel on the wall. These aluminum reels have been great! I used some 3&#34; deep masonry anchors to mount it to the brick foundation on my home. Installation took about 20 minutes, but it is rock solid. You do want to make sure that it is well secured and leveled especially if you are going to use 125 feet of hose. If you will be mounting it to siding you will want to make sure to mount it wall studs. The mounting holes are spaced 16&#34; apart to land on standard stud spacings. At a minimum I would make sure the right side which is where the crank handle is located, is on a stud.I have a 125 foot hose and was a little concerned that it would not fit on this new reel. The 704 model has a reel that is about 4 inches wider that this 710 model. However this 710 model is deeper and did just hold all 125 feet. I would recommend that you use a lesser length like 100 ft or 75 ft if you can as it is much easier to reel in.The fit and finish on these are great. I've had my other reel for well over a couple of years and it has not rusted at all. The finish has faded slightly but not too terribly. I may take the hose out and mask and spray paint a new finish on it next year if needed.To rotate the reel use need to pull up on the large knob at the center of the front edge of the top of the platform. This will raise a downward facing locking pin that will disengage from a hole slot in the reel mounting plate and allow you to pick another hole. There are 4 holes which allow you to choose 90 degree increments. I guess in a pinch you could add your own custom angles by drilling extra holes in the plate. I may try this.Overall I don't think you will be disappointed is either Liberty Garden Hose Reels as they are well made and designed. Finally, a long lasting hose reel!5 stars easy!\"]\n",
            " [\"This Liberty Garden Navigator Rotating Garden Hose Reel is very sturdy and heavy. I couldn't put it where my old hose was located because it protrudes so far, it would have dented my car.The screws that came with it didn't seem high quality enough to support the heaviness of the reel. One of my concerns is that this entire thing is going to rip out of my house's wood siding; it's so heavy by itself, then add a heavy water soaked hose to it...I'll update after more use.\"]\n",
            " ['This hose reel is both pretty and convenient.  I like that it hangs on the wall rather than sitting on the ground because it is less in the way (I don\\'t have a deck to worry about).  And the rotating feature will let me move my hose around to different parts of my yard so much more easily.The back brackets are just over 10 inches long so they fit perfectly and lie flat on my 1950s cedar shakes.  If you have smaller siding, you might have more trouble getting it to sit right on the siding.  (The installation instructions contemplate a flat wall.) The reel pieces go on after you fasten the bracket piece so you don\\'t have to hold the whole thing while you fasten it to the wall.Speaking of fastening, this product does not come with the screws necessary to mount it on your wall.  So it would be a good idea to go out and get the screws while you wait for this to arrive.  The manufacturer recommends (4) 7 or 8 mm lag screws with washers (5/16\" x 2 1/2\") for a flat wood frame wall.  For a brick masonry wall they suggest (4) 7 or 8 mm x 60 mm masonry wall anchors, (4) anchor sleeves, (4) washers, (4) lock washers, and (4) nuts.I am slightly concerned about how this metal hose reel will hold up in Minnesota weather.  However, the manufacturer suggests the hose reel part be taken off and stored indoors or sealed in a plastic container over the winter.  That just leaves the bracket to worry about.']\n",

My house is built from adobe and I cannot anchor things like this to it without pulling it apart. Our barn has studs that are 18 inches and didn't fit. Finally what we did was take a 2x12 and cut it into a rectangle, mount the roller on it and then mount the rectangle of wood on our barn. I don't think you could mount this on cinder block or any of the thinner wooden fencing. This can be a problem as you obviously want it close to a spigot.The unit is VERY heavy.

Good in that it is not a piece of junk, bad in that you need some serious support to hold it while you yank a hose out of it.I like the tray, great for an extra nozzle or hose splitter.We put a maxflow hose that is only 50 feet so lots of spare room on the winding wheel.Kind of a bummer that there is no auto retraction, but-- hey, it is very attractive and much nicer than the two plastic units I have.\"]\n",

It held our heavy-duty 100-foot hose with room to spare and the wind is easy to reel back in.As others have noted, there is no reel lock, so the hose tends to droop a bit, but not more than 2-3' feet and can be mitigated with a tuck of the end into the rest of the hose. (Though even that occasionally falls out.) All in all, while not ideal, this isn't a major gripe for me.Overall, this is well-made item that does exactly what it says it will and looks good doing it.

Hoping to avoid that.  But, oh, well.You will have to attach this unit to your wall studs, which is always a challenge since you can't find studs using a stud finder.  So, you have to use the old Poke-N-Hope method.  Take a masonry bit, (small one).  Drill a hole and then see if you get resistance.  If you don't find resistance, then you haven't hit the stud.

            " ['This is my favorite of the Perky-Pet Hummingbird Feeders that I own. This is my second favorite feeder afterSchrodt Designs Model HBL-B Cobalt Hummingbird Feederto which this is very similar. Let me first describe this feeder and then give you a quick compare and contrast .The nectar holder is clear glass cylinder. Build seems good; there is no description of safety glass so I assume it would shatter if broken. Both ends screw off for easy filling and cleaning of the glass cylinder. Just place the flat end down, fill with a solution of 1 part Baker\\'s Sugar Ultrafine Pure Cane Sugar (found at your supermarket) to 3-4 parts tap water. Screw on the hummingbird feeder basin while the glass cylinder is still upside down. Then screw on the top of the feeder keeping the feeder upside down. Turn the feeder over to release the sugar water into the basin. And hang. Simple. If you spill some sugar water in the process, a light rinse before hanging will help prevent attracting ants and other critters.The basin is plastic surrounded by a metal wire for the hummingbirds to perch while taking a more relaxing drink. We live in the hot desert. I like that the basin is plastic: easier to clean, DOES NOT HEAT the water and is protected from the sun by a sturdy metal base cover with bright red \"flower\" feeding ports. I\\'m sorry that the perch metal wire around the basin is metal. I\\'ve noticed from other models of our Perky-Pet feeders and this too that the hummers don\\'t like holding on to a metal perch in the heat of the sun. But they will sit early in the morning and in the late dusk hour.I like the large reinforced metal wire loop at the top of the feeder--easy to hang and it\\'s not going to break even in brisk weather.The copper color is painted on. It seems like a nice paint and ours has a few spots missing and smudged but the hummers will never notice nor will I unless the feeder is in shade and I\\'m 8 inches away scrutinizing. It\\'s fine.Comparisons to the Schrodt Design Schrodt Designs Model HBL-B Cobalt Hummingbird FeederVery Similar -- I prefer Schrodt\\'s colored curved glass. It\\'s much lovelier and elegant and probably keeps the 7 oz of sugar water they hold from heating up in the sun. You get bacteria growth from sunlight on sugar water. Whenever you notice the water getting cloudy, something floating in the water or the birds not feeding like they use to, you probably have bacteria growth and need to clean your feeder well. In these instances I will clean them with bleach water and rinse 3 times. One also should find an alternate location more shaded to move the feeder. This may be easier for you but it\\'s kindof hard out here in the land of the sun. The nice design with this Perky-Pet Hummingbird Feeder is that the little hat provides some sun protection--maybe. The Schrodt feeders are copper and redwood. After 6 years of constant use they do not leak when hanging and I am careful with a quick rinse if I spill any when I turn it upside down. They are pieces of Art and at just over $36 whereas this is half the price. Good Value, Perky-Pets! The Schrodt design is harder to clean but again in 6 years, I\\'ve probably had bacteria growth floating in water in the Schrodt design, maybe 4 times over 3 feeders in nearly full sun.This is our 8th feeder. We have lots of hummingbirds and we plant to attact them. This feeder is a winner.']\n",

It is easy to fill and clean. The old feeder required a long bottlebrush to clean, and even then it was difficult to keep the very top clean. This accommodates a larger brush and is easier to keep clean. It also holds a reasonable amount of liquid. Some people may think larger capacity is better, but it is preferable to refill and clean the feeder more often. In addition, hummingbirds are territorial, and it is unlikely that more than one will feed at a time.The nectar is easy to use: just add 8 ounces of water and mix. No boiling is required and the solution dissolved quickly. I will go back to my old water and sugar solution but I enjoyed trying the included sample packet.']\n",

The mouth of the feeder is wide enough to pour the nectar in with ease.2. Both ends screw off on this feeder, so clean up is a breeze. *3. The glass tube is thick so this part of the feeder should last for ages.4. The feeder looks very nice, not overly garish.5. The bee guards are a great idea.6. The 12 ounce capacity makes refilling less of a hassle.My concerns:1. While the 12 ounce capacity is nice, I am worried that mold will be an issue if the humming birds are not feeding frequently. (I only filled the unit a quarter full and am going to monitor how quickly the nectar goes before increasing the amount I put in - we are early days for humming birds right now.)2. Rust - these sorts of feeders are always prone to rusting, time will tell if this is an issue with this particular unit.3. Color - I really do not like overly garish feeders but we all know that humming birds are attracted to flash, this unit is on the elegant side and time will tell if it has enough brightness to attract the birds.Recommended with above reservations.*The totally unintentional rhyming ends here - you are welcome.']\n",

So far I have not been bothered by either when using this feeder.The feeder is an attractive copper with a glass bottle.  The bottle has a wide mouth for easy filling and the feeder comes with an initial supply of Perky Pet.  The bottom of my feeder is indeed removable and comes apart to clean the internals.  However, the bottom is plastic and does not stay connected unless I use the originally supplied twist ties to keep it affixed.  This also leads to some leakage over time.Overall &#8211; this is a very attractive feeder that is well-liked by the hummers.  My biggest issue is the design of the base and keeping the metal portion connected to the plastic bottom.  Other than that&#8230;this is a great upgrade for a traditional all-plastic feeder.']\n",

Within minutes of filling the feeder and hanging it I had a hummingbird, and she's been coming back ever since.It's a nice design, looks a lot classier than the ugly plastic red ones you can buy for cheap.  Easy to open, fill and reassemble.

It cleans up easily and actually sits flat on the counter so that you can easily fill it up with nectar.  You then attach the top and bottom again and hang outside.The feeder flowers are actually formed to be bee guards, so that they can't reach the nectar. Sweet!NOTES:*This is a copper finish!*There are two plastic pieces, one under the top lid, that the glass attaches to and also one under the copper finished, flower feeder part.  The bird resting wire is copper finished and attached to the bottom of the plastic piece.  It think it would be difficult to seal if it didn't have the plastic piece, but I am not sure.I have the bird seed feeder( Perky Pet Antique Copper Bird Feeder)that matches this hummingbird feeder and it has help up very well over the past year or so.

Cleaning requires unscrewing the top and bottom from a clear glass tube and hand washing with warm soapy water twice a week.  Then screw the feeder base with bee guards onto the glass tube, add up to 12 oz/355 ml nectar, screw the top on, and hang the feeder in an easily visible area.The Perky Pet 710B hummingbird feeder is the first feeder I've owned or attempted to use.  After a month, I've yet to see a hummingbird and the nectar level hasn't changed.  A week in and I started to wonder what I was doing wrong.  Between Perky Pet's companion website and some advice from friends, I learned that hummingbirds are territorial, have poor eyesight, and are attracted to bright red and orange colors.  Perky Pet's interactive hummingbird migration map also verified sightings in my area.  After learning this, I started looking at plants for the yard which might help attract hummingbirds and relocated the feeder from a secluded area off the back porch to a more visible spot outside my kitchen window.Even though I've yet to feed a hummingbird, I can't blame the Perky Pet 710B hummingbird feeder.  This feeder is simple to clean, fill, and maintain, not to mention easy on the eyes.  If you're looking for a stylish hummingbird feeder, I highly recommend the Perky Pet 710B hummingbird feeder.PROS:Simple to clean and fillBee guards protect nectar from bees and wasps12 month limited warrantyCONS:None I could find\"]\n",

You have a place to add the nectar, a place where the birds sip and a way to hang it.  This feeder excels in all the areas.  First, it's compact in size (measuring just under 11 inches and not including the substantial wire hanger - and just under 7inches at the circular bird perch).  The column of thick glass holds 12oz of the bird nectar and is MUCH easier to pour in because the mouth is wider than previous models I've had.The Brushed Copper is well done but know, the bottom is plastic (what the glass tube screws into) but it's out of site and makes the feeder able to be under 2 lbs.I really like the looks of this feeder and the steel hook is ideal.

But I would not buy these copper feeders for the long haul because I have another style in the line and it is already starting to show signs of rust and not holding up well.

Additionally the nectar does easily stay preserved for weeks in this unit compared to the week or two max that sugar water would last in my other hummingbird feeder.  Evaporation also seems slighter with this feeder.  The only baffling thing is I rarely see a hummingbird on this feeder, whereas my cheap red plastic one had them constantly the last few years.  I'm not sure what to attribute that to - weather? feeder style? nectar vs sugar?\"]\n",

I love the &#34;wide mouth&#34; feature of the glass ~ a regular bottle brush does the trick nicely for cleaning purposes. The copper actually *does* add an elegant touch, however I'm not a fan of the red, plastic flowers at the feed openings. I realize they are bee guards, and they seem to be doing their job; I just wish they would have made them in some other material and/or color. I'm a firm believer that if you have hummers in your area, your feeders need not have anything red on them (or in them...powdered food!), because they will come. It's so easy to make your own humming bird food (1:4 sugar/water ratio ~ Google it:) ~  I have this hanging on my farmer's porch where it's not totally exposed to the elements so the copper should hold up.Literally, within 15 minutes of putting this feeder up, I had a gorgeous male Ruby Red Throat at the feeder, squeaking away while he was eating. I admit, I didn't think they would come it *that* quickly, because it usually takes a bit of time for them to get used to any new feeders.This is a nice addition to my collection, pretty to look at, easy to clean, and feeds my hummers ~ wonderful!\"]\n",

            " [\"This is the third Perky Pet hummingbird feeder I've tested, and it's my favorite. It's the most attractive, with a glass cylinder and a copper finish on the metal cap and the plastic base surround, with metal flowers surrounding the ports that are protected by what the company identifies as bee guards. We haven't hit the time of year when bees are a problem around our hummingbird feeders, so I can't attest to their effectiveness.The glass cylinder is quite narrow, so it will be difficult to clean without a bottle brush. I also suggest getting a small brush to clean the ports, as they are deep enough that you really want to make sure that they get clean. The base comes apart, so it's easy to clean, but the metal flowers will slow you down a little. It's worth it, though, since they add to the attractiveness of the feeder. I didn't have any trouble with leaking, which was reported in some other reviews.The hummingbirds seem to like this feeder the best as well. Of the three feeders (all cylinder-style), they have been most attracted to this feeder. They do seem to have some problem perching and eating at the same time. It's possible that the bee guards are impeding their ability to get to the juice while sitting on the perches, as they usually hover while feeding.As with the 30-ounce feeder, this feeder came with a packet of nectar concentrate. I recommend tossing it in the garbage, and make a fresh batch of nectar by using four parts boiled water to one part sugar. The packet contains red dye, which the company states is harmless to the birds, but it's not necessary to attract them, so why take the chance?This is a very attractive feeder and would make a great gift. While they are not nearly as attractive, I still prefer the dish-style feeders, like the Aspects Hummzinger feeders that are available here, and the similar Wild Birds Unlimited-branded feeders, but this is pretty good as well.\"]\n",

The unit has a sufficinetly large opening, so it can be filled relatively easily.If you need a larger feeder like this, it may be a good choice.  However, be mindful of the fact that the sugar water must be changed every five (5) days or so.  Accordingly, you may find that sixteen (16) ounces of fluid is more than you need and you may end up pouring most of it out at the end of the week.  An eight (8) ounce unit may be a better choice.This model lacks an included hook for hanging.The bottle of this model is not open at each end, it is more difficult to clean than a model with a larger opening at the top.  Perky Pet makes at least one other model which opens on both ends allowing you to clean and fill the glass jar though the larger end. That means that you can use a soapy paper towel (rinse well afterwards with hot water to remove all traces of soap), to clean the bottle rather than having to purchase and use a narrow bottle washer brush.I have four different models, but far prefer the Perky Pet Perky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Top Fill Hummingbird Feeder which has not of the above shortcomings and is a easy to fill and clean.

The body of the feeder is plastic.I prefer glass bottles since they're easier to keep clean and don't get discolored by sunlight so you can tell when your feeding solution is getting cloudy and you can change it.I've not had an issue with ants, but there's a small 'moat' around the top to help keep them from stealing and the 'bee guard' helps keep bees from flooding the area around the feeder. This is especially important for my kids since they are bothered by bees being too close.The perch at the bottom of the feeder is removable, but I like to let the hummingbirds rest while they feed since it takes a lot of energy to hover in place.\"]\n",

It's like a bird bar, a welcoming watering hole for hummingbirds.As others on the U.S. boards have noted, you will need to take a small bottle brush to clean this and it is recommended that you clean it once a week.  I also like the fact that it came with a bag of nectar.  However, the only thing that bothered me was that the nectar was red.  Food dye is not good for hummingbirds.  When I make hummingbird food, I boil up sugar in water (usually 1:1 ratio).  However, the birds are enjoying it and that is what matters.\"]\n",

LOVE the ant moat at the top - just fill with water and the little buggers find it pretty hard to get to the juice.  Great idea, as the ants can really be a problem here certain times of the year.It holds 16 ounces of nectar, which is plenty for around here.  We don't get hordes of hummers so if the nectar sits in there too long without being emptied, it gets fouled.The only drawback I can see is that the base on the bottom says &#34;tighten&#34; with arrows showing the direction, but it seems to just press-fit, with no threads to actually secure it?

I am not sure if this is a quality control issue because the design (a common one) is sound and I have seldom encountered it before.

In the meantime since it was hot the water that is suppose to keep out the ants evaporated and I ended up with ants actively feeding and getting into the feeder.  Then the birds will not drink.

The birds must know quality better than most.  This one is glass and frankly, I am a glass snob with vigor.  Glass cleans better and lasts longer while apparently not leaving any residue from cleaning.Let's start at the moat top.  Instead of having to arrange a separate contraption such as I have previously and will do again this year, this feeder has an area in the top that permits visitors from below to stop by and drown.  I've always wondered if the dead creatures would be eaten by the hummers, but I have no evidence of that taking place.  But I always look.  The red top unscrews to permit full cleaning of the glass container.  I used a metal rod for holding plants to stakes to configure a tie down for the top's hanger.  It works well for me and I can control the size.The pinch waist permits more steady control of the feeder when holding or going from one location to another, but the real sensible addition to this feeder is the hummers' goodies (food) goes into the bottom instead of the top.  Picture turning the feeder upside down with the top engaged onto the glass feeder and pouring the food into the feeder while it is sitting on the sink.  When you have filled the feeder to the level you want, screw the bottom of the unit while still upside down and carry it to the feeder.  At that point turn the unit over and place it on the Shepard's hook or whatever you use to hold the feeder.  The incidence of spillage will reduce immediately.  (As was said by someone who could spill a steel rod.)After screwing the roosts onto the main unit and assuring their proper place in front of the little feeder holes the rest is as simple.  The bottom consists of two pieces which helps with keeping the entire unit clean and the hummers appreciate it.Right now, this unit has jumped from last to first in one week's use.  Another Perky-Pet occupies that #1 position and in a few days it will be joined by another family member.  Those little critters provide so much joy to us and some of our neighbors.\"]\n",

They absolutely adore it.We've been feeding hummingbirds at this house for 18 years now and we have tried pretty much everything over those years. If you've seen a style of hummingbird feeder, we've probably played with it. Right now we have probably twelve different old hummingbird feeders in a bin by the shed that I keep for who knows what reason. Out of all the styles, this is the one we're using now and we (and they) love it.It's quite easy to fill. The wide mouth means the liquid goes in easily. When they drink it doesn't create a large &#34;air bubble&#34; that temporarily scares them off. We have this on a double shepherd's crook in our back yard so it's not &#34;super stable&#34; by any stretch - and it doesn't leak at all. The ant water trap at the top works just the way it should and we just refill that each morning when we put it out.I'm surprised by people who complain that they have to fill the water each day - aren't you refilling your feeder each day? Or bringing it in at night? If we don't bring ours in, raccoons climb right up and drink from it :). And we like to give our hummingbirds fresh nectar each day - sugar-water in the sun is not an eternally fresh item.I'm not sure what to say to those who have a leaky unit. We haven't had any leaking at all and, as mentioned, it's hanging in a breezy location. Maybe it's something about how tightly we screw it. Part of what keeps a feeder from leaking is the vacuum that forms.In any case, our hummingbirds adore it, we love it, and this is our new favorite for the back yard.I was offered a free sample for review.\"]\n",

This is very important since a sugar solution in sunlight and heat spoils quickly and can make the birds sick.2.  The color definitely attracts them.  There is NO need to use colored solution and it is actually better not to since the dye is not good for the birds.  The bright color of the feeder itself is enough to attract hummingbirds.3.  If you have problems with bees or ants, this feeder us setup to help you keep them at bay.  The clever trap for ants at the top and the bee guards do a very nice job!!4.  This feeder holds just enough food to be able to supply a large number of birds before you would need to clean it out anyway.  We found that if we fill it about 2/3 full, it was enough for the birds to go through most of it before it was time to clean it out.  Depending upon the amount of sun and heat, it takes 3 to 6 days for the liquid to start to cloud up and to require replacement.  ALWAYS clean your feeder when you change food!!Things that we did not like as much:1.  The perch is sort of a pain to keep aligned.  It is really necessary, probably not, but the birds will take advantage of it if it is there.All in all, this is very well made product that works as it should.  One quick note, any feeder will leak if it is in high winds!!!  When the winds were less than 12 mph we did not find any issue with leakage.']\n",
            " [\"This feeder is okay. It's similar to other Perky Pet models, but it is just a little too small to be worth the effort. If you want to be filling it up pretty frequently, by all means go ahead and get it, but otherwise it's easier to just get something a little bigger and not have to worry about refilling as often.\"]\n",

            " [\"I have a few hummingbird feeders. The Perky-Pet Pinch Waist Glass feeder seems like a good one. The main problems with hummingbird feeders is they can leak, they fill up with ants and the wasps take over and keep the birds away. This feeder after being up for a week does not leak. They have addressed the other issues, but it will be awhile in Wisconsin before these other issues are tested. The area where the bird gets the juice has a raised end point to keep the wasps from getting the juice. The top of the feeder has a reservoir which can be filled with water to keep the ants from crossing over to the feeder from the hanger. I have not yet been able to test these, but they do seem like good ideas.One problem that I can foresee is that the water will evaporate quickly and will require attention. The container for the provided nectar fills the feeder about half way. Generally we just use sugar and water which is boiled to purify. This takes time and a  premix would be nice, though the one that comes with the unit does have food coloring in it which I see as unnecessary. The perches on the feeder are very flimsy but then...hummingbirds don't weigh much.  Overall you likely cannot go wrong with this feeder. If the pest &#34;fixes&#34; don't work, you have a good feeder which will be just like all other feeders anyway.\"]\n",

Where we live hummingbirds aren't plentiful so none so far has been spotted but I have little doubt that this will work.  The unit also comes with a small connecting hook that goes into the unit so the other end could be hung onto a hook that is typically too thick to go onto the unit itself.  That is a very nice feature.  However, the hook is not easily found as it is not inside the glass container but into the bottom of the unit.  You have to open the bottom of the unit by unscrewing the base from the bottom to get the hook out.  Strange place to store a useful part of the unit.  Many customers may not know to check for that.\"]\n",

Hummingbirds are very social birds and like to be close to humans.  I like to have several bird feeders for them around my deck and I love to watch them drinking.This one is basically as good as any of them but it has one flaw, this one leaks a lot more than the others, the slightest tilt and the sugar water just runs right out of it.  It poured all over my deck and by the time I hung it there was nothing left. Now I have ants coming by the hundreds to suck up the sweet water.  I do like the fact that it is made of glass and not plastic, If I can get it up without spilling any it might be worth hanging, but I will not be buying one any time soon']\n",
            " ['UPDATE 6/22/14:  I have gotten so many compliments on this set.  Everyone that sees it loves it.  Also the chair cushions are the most comfortable, especially for long time sitting.  One thing, which is why the 4 stars remain.  There are no ties on the back cushions and there really should be.  The bottom cushions have them, why not the back cushions??  I have to go out and pick up the cushions constantly as they blow around the back yard at the mildest wind.  It is windy here in So. AZ and I have had to sew on ties myself.  This would have made the set perfect if they came with the ties already on.  Still love it, however.It took about an hour to unpack and assemble.  It came in three large boxes, shrink wrapped and on a pallet.  The longest part was the unpacking.  It was well protected, with lots of heavy paper wrapped around every part of the chairs.  The chairs, themselves, come in two pieces and have four bolts to put in which is very easy if you have a helper but not impossible for one person to do.  The fire pit itself came completely assembled.  However, to get it through the house to the back yard I did have to take the top off.  That was easy since it had only four screws holding that on.Everything is well made and the chairs are very comfortable.  The seat bottom is made in a way so that it is not supposed to sag over time.  The reason for the 4 stars is the color of the upholstery.  It tends to be on the yellowish side of brown and everything in my yard leans toward reddish brown. The product picture even has a slight reddish tone to it.  Wish there was a choice of upholstery colors.  But I must say I am very pleased with the quality.This set will be outside 24/7 in Southern Arizona so the cloth and the metal finish will really get a tough test.  I would like to download my pictures but did not see anyway to do it for this product.']\n",
            " [\"Hanover's Summer Night set is very, very nice. It is high quality and very well made. We absolutely love it. The set came very well packaged...BIG, but well packaged. Everything we received was in excellent condition and there was no damage to any of the furniture. I was definitely worried about putting this set together, but it went together incredibly smoothly and I will even say easily. I have to admit, I did not put it together myself, I am not able to physically right now, but my daughter and two of her friends (all three 19 years old) had the whole set together and everything up and running in about an hour, maybe a little longer. I watched them put the chairs together and they were really just two pieces and the bolts. Once the figured out the first chair, the next 3 were easy. Same for the table/fire pit, once they got the gist of the instructions it went together pretty easy. I still can't believe it. I was pretty proud of them.I thought it would be in parts in my yard for a week at least. The only thing one of them did say, is it would have been nice to have some written instructions rather than just the drawn kind, but they did figure those out, it just took a little longer.Now that it's together, we just love it. We love the look of the set and everything is just so well made. The chairs rock very nicely, but do not tip back too far and the cushions are sturdy, thick and really just awesome to sit on. I've never had really well made patio cushions before, so I am appreciating the ones with this set. One little thing I will mention that isn't a big deal, but more of a personal preference is that I wish the the backs on the chairs were just a little higher. That is a personal thing though and I am the only one who mentioned it in using the set, maybe because I am taller, I just prefer my chair backs a little higher.It's been pretty cool in the evenings so we have been getting quite a bit of use out of the fire pit and table. It is just perfect for a cool evening. Easy to set up and use, we have enjoyed it many nights already.I went back and forth between a 4 and 5 review for this set. Recently the set here on Amazon was priced at $1,299 and at the price it is definitely a 5 star patio set. Now though, it is priced at $1,799 and even though it is a very nice quality set, I can't quite give it 5 stars, the price now being the reason for the 4 star review today 6/17/14. The patio set itself is very nice though, I wouldn't hesitate in recommending to anyone, just maybe shop around a little bit first.\"]\n",
            " [\"There are a few aspects of this well-made set that should get some attention in a review, especially for a high-ticket item like this one.ARRIVAL AND ASSEMBLY - at least as I received it, it comes in three big boxes on a pallet. As other reviews noted, it will take about about an hour to break everything down, take all the packing paper off, get it all out of the boxes THEN you can start to actually construct it.Good news - while the paper is all taped around the chair's metal frames, it is easily ripped masking tape. So it wasn't difficult to get the packing paper off, just time consuming. And that's a good thing! The set should arrive without any dings or damage.The fire pit comes assembled. It is a TWO person job to move it, and it it's in top box. So expect to need two people to do all this.The chairs are easy to assemble with two people AND a socket wrench set. I tried to use the included wrench, but that would have taken forever! But using a socket wrench took maybe two minutes a chair - very easy. Again - two person job. I wouldn't even try to do it myself. The chairs are not light, and to line up and then screw in the bolts is not worth the hassle of doing it yourself. And to repeat - use a socket wrench.You are going to be left with an enormous amount of packing material - again, not a bad thing. Just make some space before it all arrives so you don't huge cardboard boxes getting in your way after the fact.QUALITY - this is really the most important thing anyway, and on this score, this set seems worth the money and very well-made.The chairs are metal with welded slats to enable the rocking. While the metal is light, it's still heavy-duty enough to hold up against the sun and the rain (I hope, anyway). The rocking motion is nice and i think a neat switch from a standard unmoving chair.The cushions are thick fabric - and you're going to pay at least $50 for a similar cushion anywhere I've seen. Maybe more, since this is a two cushion set. Again, the fabric seems good quality and should hold up.If you paid $225 for the chair/cushion, you'd be looking at $900 for the set and I don't think that's unreasonable. Expensive, but not unreasonable or unexpected. The cushions would probably be included.The fire pit is solid, and while I don't love the design on the sides, it's okay and you won't notice it that much. The pit itself is not that high and a few chairs around the edge will fill it in quite nicely. It certainly would cost $400 by itself - probably more. And with the chairs, that puts this at a fair price of $1300, which is what it's currently listed at.As for the fire pit performance, I haven't used it yet, but I'll update that part of it later. I wanted to do all this now while it was fresh in my head! It's not like you'll be cooking on the flame, anyway. It's mostly for the ambience.SIZE - I have a 20x11 deck, and that is the minimum amount of space you need - assuming you already have other deck furniture. I already had a table, a few chairs and a chaisse lounge. Obviously, these chairs replaced a few others - but even then, the space got filled quick. Ideally, you'd have a 20x16 space, and I think that would be perfect.The chairs rock, so you can't push them up against a fence or railing - not a negative, just be aware. They take up space but they are big and comfortable. They are deep cushioned, so you'll end up sitting back from the table a little bit.The fire pit measures 38x38, but again - it's more than that. You need space for the chairs to have space, and it's going to take up a lot, quick. So if you ALREADY have a table/umbrella like most decks do, be aware of all that.None of this is a bad thing, and most buyers probably have a lot more space than me and it won't even be an issue.To sum up - good quality that feels high-end and well-made. They're charging high-end price and they are delivering a product that seems to deserve it. The cushions and the rocking chair are fun. The fire pit ledge gives a good space to put drinks, but I don't think I'd try to use it as an eating surface.It doesn't come with a cover, and I would get one. I don't like the idea of rainwater getting underneath the rocks...although since it doesn't have a base, the water won't collect in anything. Still, I would get a cover.At $1300, it's pricey, but I think you'll get what you're paying for - I like these chairs, and the pit is a neat addition to the deck ambiance. I will update this review as I see the quality prove itself over the sun and rain of the summer months.\"]\n",
            " [\"This is an absolutely beautiful set of furniture.  The shipping was outstanding.  I have never seen pieces wrapped so carefully and completely before.  Everything arrived in perfect condition.  Prepare yourself for three really large and heavy boxes.  There are two chairs per box and the table is separate.  As far as assembly, it took about 45 minutes for the first chair and once we had that finished and knew how to do it, it took about 45 minutes total to do the other three.  The table comes in just two parts so that was easy.  It's really just a visually stunning set and the comfort level exceeded my expectations.  We've used it almost ever night so far and expect it to last for years and years.  I am so very pleased with this set and would highly recommend it to anyone.\"]\n",
            " ['I\\'m a little stumped on how to rate this set.  From a construction standpoint both the chairs and the fire pit are top notch, but while I love the chairs I honestly don\\'t care for the \"look\" of the fire pit.  It is just too Gothic/medieval looking for my tastes.Chairs:* The chairs are sturdy and well-constructed (will probably last for decades).  Everything seems to be made of the highest quality materials.*  The frames are made of heavy-gauge aluminum-alloy, and finished in an attractive shade of oiled-rubbed bronze.  There are subtle hints of gold along the edges of the metal bars and the circular details on the sides of the chair.*  The welded joints are flat and smooth with no rough seams to snag your clothing or prick your fingers.*  The chairs are described as rockers, but the motion is very subtle.  The \"rocking\" is a smooth back and forth motion and with very little of an up and down element, more like a glider and less like the see-saw motion of a traditional rocking chair.* The cushions are plump and the stuffing is soft.  The fabric is thick enough to withstand years of exposure to the elements.  But I also found the think fabric a little stiff and coarse (more on the burlap end than the polished cotton end).  The color of the fabric is an earthy kind of yellowish brown.  It is a little dull and boring at first glance, but I added some bright floral throw pillows to brighten it up.  The bottom cushions have extra strong Velcro straps to secure them to the chair, but the back cushion is not attached to the chair.  Having the back cushion loose lets you adjust the plump cushion for the most comfortable position.  The loose, back cushion also allows a tall person to remove it completely.  I have some tall (6\\'+) people in the family, and they have mentioned that the fat pillows force them to sit too far forward in the chair.  Removing the back cushion makes them feel less like they are perched on the edge of the seat.  The metal back of the chair is also nicely curved so sitting without the back cushion is completely comfortable.Fire Pit:I\\'m sorry but I just don\\'t like the way the fire pit looks.  It is big and bulky and looks like something you would find in a medieval castle, or at Stonehenge, or at Machu Picchu.  Did I mention that it was Big?  And Huge?  And Heavy?  This is not something that you can easily put away during the summer.  I also don\\'t care for the molded decorations on the sides of the pit.  The fiberglass is painted black and gold to match the chairs, but the dark colors just make the pit look like a massive boulder.  My first impression when I unboxed the pit was that someone had sent me King Arthur\\'s Stone.But on a positive note the fire pit is easy to operate.  Hooking up the propane is a snap, and the lava rocks are so much nicer than the popping wood of my old fire pit.  It is also great that you can adjust the flame to suite the mood or the outside temperature.  But I do wish the pit came with a cover to conceal and protect the element/fire ring when not in use.  The fire pit is too big to store in the shed during the summer so I\\'m afraid the pit will have to weather the heat, humidity and rain of summer.  I expect bugs and mildew will invade the dark recesses of the pit in no time flat.So how many stars?  I\\'ll give it 4.  I love the chairs and most of my objections to the fire pit are just a matter of personal taste.']\n",

After 3-weeks of use (Washing two cars and daily watering of potted plants and shrubs) I have had nothing but success.This hose is super-light and has provided consistent flow, zero kinks, and zero leaks in my short period of ownership and operation.Having the valve on the end is also a big plus as you can control the flow without the need of an attachment.I'll follow-up in a few weeks as the weather warms up.\"]\n",

            " [\"This Rumford Gardener Tuff-Guard Expanding Hose is the second hose of this genre I tested.  The first one was the lime green Rumford Gardener Expanding Hose.  It broke at multiple places in three months on very light use.  This second expanding hose fared even worse; it exploded with a loud pop on my driveway on the second use.Knowing the vulnerability of this kind of hoses, I had treated this hose with kid-gloves.  I turned on the water valve from  to  and let the hose expand over a period of one minute before I turned on the valve fully.  I used the hose only on smooth cement surface.  I drained the hose after use and stored it in a covered bucket in my covered patio.  The water pressure of my house is consistently around 75 psi, well within the norm of residential water supply.  My advice to Amazon shoppers is to stick to heavy-duty rubber hoses.  They are heavy and clunky but they don't explode in your faces like these expandable hoses.P.S. There is no warranty or any contact info of the manufacturer in the box. The only recourse a buyer has in case of problem with this hose is to return to Amazon within one month. Outside of that, he/she is hosed.\"]\n",
            " [\"I have some really nice, heavy-duty hoses for washing the car, etc. Sometimes, though, it'd be nice to have a lighter hose for watering plants or something -- a hose that doesn't require a special storage rack & the effort of winding it back up when I'm done using it.For a while, I used one of those self-coiling plastic hoses (like the hose version of a slinky) but it always got coiled around itself and ended up being less convenient than just a normal hose, really.THIS hose, however, is awesome. It combines the durability of a heavy-duty hose with convenience and compactness.+ outer webbing provides superior protection from abrasion, and the elements+ rubber inner hose material is lightweight, but expands to full size+ compact and flexible when not in use+ built-in spigot means I don't even need a spray handle attachment with this hoseThe only 'downside' is -- this hose gives me a little less water output than a normal garden hose. It's plenty for watering the plants, but might be less than ideal for washing off the pool deck or rinsing off your car. Other than that, I think it's awesome. Highly recommended.\"]\n",
            " ['I love the idea and have used an expanding hose before, even directly compared this one to a new Pocket Hose Ultra.  This one had too many drawbacks for me.  After I got this hose untangled which took a while (it doesn\\'t compress as small as the Pocket Hose) I connected it eagerly.  I was impressed by the brass fittings and sturdy appearance of the hose, but it\\'s maybe too much of a good thing.  First off it wouldn\\'t expand smoothly.  The crinkled fabric outer skin bunched up in various areas restricting the water flow to other parts.  I couldn\\'t manually smooth out the troubled areas, but figured since I didn\\'t really need all 50\\' on my deck, that wasn\\'t a deal breaker.In order to get the hose to expand to semi-full size, its on/off \\'switch\\' must be in the off position so the water pressure builds up and forces the expansion.  When expanded in that manner, the hose is quite hard and was not easy for me to maneuver.  It is lighter weight than a rubber hose, but not very flexible. Once to the edge of my deck, I opened the pressure switch all the way and got the equivalent of the jet setting on a nozzle attachment.  The water stream projected a long way, but wouldn\\'t be suitable for watering plants.  It had the force of my small pressure washer.  Still, I thought that with a nozzle I might be able to regulate the water flow to my liking.  I never did get around to adding a nozzle though because with the pressure switch open the hose started to contract back to a smaller size and I had to work to keep it from pulling me back to the hookup.  I had to use more and more strength to keep it where I wanted it.  It was not a pleasant experience.I\\'d had enough with only the one sample use and went to turn off the water and try the Pocket Hose for comparison.  I again turned off the pressure switch on the hose as I returned to the spigot, but when I turned it back on to drain the water after turning the water off at the spigot, the hose went crazy like a striking snake and danced out of my hand spraying me all over.  Too bad someone wasn\\'t taking a video, it would win America\\'s Funniest.The Pocket Hose is a worm compared to this python.  Of course it\\'s only 1/2\" where this is 3/4\", but it\\'s far better behaved and that\\'s the hose I\\'ll be using until the plastic fittings give out.  Still I gave this hose two stars even as I sit here dripping wet because for some folks, particularly stronger people than I, the pressure and power of this hose will be a benefit and the fittings may last longer than the wimpy ones on the Pocket Hose.']\n",
            " [\"I've used another brand of this type of expanding hose before and I really liked it. This hose has the same features of expanding when in use and recoiling when you turn the water off, but it needs help to expand all the way. I have to really pull on the hose to stretch out to the (almost) 50 feet. I like that this hose has metal fittings and not plastic, like my other hose. This hose seems a bit heavier too.\"]\n",
            " [\"I needed a small, easy to hide hose to water plants. This lightweight hose fit the bill perfectly.  Basically a tube enclosed in a fabric sleeve, this expands when the water is on and collapses when not in use making it very easy to store/tuck in a small hose basket.  I also like the metal fittings which hopefully will hold up much better than the plastic fittings that tend to come with a lot of hoses these days.  No issues connecting to outside faucets or connecting various attachments.However, if you need something with a lot of power you'll need a wider hose circumference than this.  My husband used it to clean off the deck and it didn't have as much pressure as our regular hose.  It did work a better when he took off the spray attachment - enough so that he didn't bother to drag out the regular hose.\"]\n",

It is lightweight, and the best part is that it is so easy to put away and store (We all know what a pain it is to roll up a traditional hose; this does away with all that).I have only had it a couple of weeks or so.

The construction feels a bit better than the other one I own, especially with the brass fittings.It is very light and convenient to have around.  I can drag this around my yard so much easier.  However, since I had bad luck with this type of hose, I am worried about it lasting.  I am going to give it an OK rating for now until otherwise.With this kind of product, I really think it is the luck of the draw.  It seems some people get a long lasting one, while others get duds.

The brass fittings are solidly made - not those ultra-thin fittings that break the first time.  It helps that it comes in my wife's favorite color purple.  We have a large yard and our sprinklers do not cover everything perfectly.  To reach the farthest corners of our yard we need 150 feet of hose.  To cover that with this hose we'd need  6 hoses (3 for the front and 3 for the back).  That's rather expensive.  But 150 feet of regular hose is soooo heavy.  What we do is use 100 feet of regular hose and then put one of these expanding hoses on the end and that works as most of the weight you are lugging around is the final 50 feet.  because of the solid brass fittings we readily change sprayers as needed.\"]\n",

I asked him what he thinks now, and he said, \"Oh, my god, I love it!  You just have to get used to how you have to use it.  We should have gotten one of these years ago.\"  And despite our initial impressions, this is now his go-to hose when he\\'s using a sprinkler.  He\\'s also really happy that you can adjust the spray to high pressure without needing an attachment (a feature he didn\\'t think he needed at first but now regularly uses).Here\\'s my original review:This hose will NOT replace all hose needs.  If you need a very lightweight hose for, say, watering planters near the faucet, this will work.  But that\\'s about all it\\'s good for.Pros:*It\\'s shockingly light.*It does retract (sort of).Cons:*You will not get anywhere near a 50-foot reach with this thing.  30 is more like it.*The flow is VERY low.*It\\'s impractical to use with any attachment (sprinkler, for example) because the end of the hose (and the attachment) whips around when you turn off the water.*Speaking of whipping around, make sure there are no kids, pets, plants, or anything breakable in the way of this hose or near the end when you turn off the faucet.  The hose is gonna whip \\'em.*The hose doesn\\'t seem very sturdy or durable.However, if you really want and/or need a lightweight hose, as long as you know what you are in for with this type of product, this is probably among the better ones.

The large inner diameter of 3/4&#34; allows for great water flow when using the hose for washing cars, but it is not satisfactory for sprinklers, power washers, or other things that have different and varying pressures.Our primary need for garden hoses is to water lawn and garden, so this won't be of too much help.  I guess the novelty of having it curl back up into minimal space is clever and useful for many, but in our case it just looks sloppy laying on the porch or deck.  We keep our hoses in reel up storage containers and it leaves a clean, neat area.It was fun to watch the hose stretch out and return to the empty position, that's not enough to warrant the expense.\"]\n",

You position the reel in the direction that you want to water and pull out the hose, it has a connection at the faucet with a short hose to the reel with another connection and finally a connection for the garden hose-----mine always is dripping from one of the fittings.  The Gardener Tuff-Gard eliminates all of those connections and uses so much less space, without the ugly reel living by the faucet.We have our Tuff-Guard on a faucet near the patio where my wife has potted plants up the gazoo!  This is so much easier to use, no more pulling hose from the reel, dragging it around the outside chairs and plant stands and occasionally knocking something over.....and the best thing, when you're done, turn off the water, release the water pressure in the hose and kabam!----the whole thing disappears into one small neat heap!!!  By the way, the hose real is gone and so is the impossible hose that was wrapped around it.\"]\n",

For the cons - you need to follow the directions for it to work properly, the water pressure is disappointing and it is rather fragile when compared to a 'normal' hose. I've found it's better for watering plants and washing the car rather than for running a sprinkler or connecting to the pressure washer. Overall, I can see the promise in the idea but most of our water usage outside requires a bit more ooomph, so I see us sticking with a more traditional hose for now.\"]\n",

If your shed doesn't get too hot.The thing is, it seems that it's going to burst eventually even if you treat it right, but you're supposed to really handle it with kid gloves: Don't leave it out in the sun or cold. You have to shake it dry in between uses and store it indoors. It's not safe for drinking water.If you're absolutely determined to try this type of hose, then Rumford seems to be the best of them at the moment (maybe due to the better brass fitting), but that's not saying much.

If and until this type of hose becomes common, amaze your neighbors and scare children as this thing expands like some deadly snake awakening from slumber and then retracts in jerky, life-like spasms.Pros:-REALLY light and compact. almost looks like a limp ribbon hanging under the faucet. You could stuff it in a little flower pot. There is no tedious winding or tangling: that is huge for me.-Solid metal ends. Apparently they are brass; They are not flimsy stamped metal. Also, the end has a built-in ball valve; you almost do not need to add a nozzle because small adjustments of the lever let the stream evolve from shower to jet.-Handles our 70 lb. water pressure just fine, although I find the stream more like what comes out of a half inch hose than a 5/8th.-So far does not seem to tangle or kink.Cons:-You can\\'t just turn on the water and use it. You must allow it to fill slowly. It is fun to watch but takes well a minute.-According to instructions, you mustn\\'t store it in direct sunlight. How long before this thing deteriorates?-You must also let it drain. Don\\'t keep it under pressure; but this happens quicker than \"inflating\".-If this thing leaks or you damage the female end, there is no repairing it like a conventional hose, so take care.I Will update if there are durability issues, but so far, this is my new hose.']\n",

The Rumfort Gardener Tuff-Guard Expanding Hose is a real blessing, because it's lighter, more compact, more attractive, and makes the chore so much easier.  Simply attach the female coupling to the water source, turn the on-off valve to off, turn the water at the source by slowly increasing the pressure, and the hose will automatically expand to approximately 50 feet.  The solid brass valve can be adjusted to get a powerful spray, but is designed to attach a sprinkler too.  Simply follow the basic instructions, attach the sprinkler while the valve is off, face the sprinkler away from you, place it where needed, and turn the valve on.  However, it is not recommended that you use a high pressure nozzle or pressure washer, so this may be an issue for some people - hence the 4-stars.  When finished watering, allow the water in the hose to flow out by leaving the valve on, and the hose will shrink to a smaller size.Warnings found in the instructions are, that it is not intended for drinking water; do not stretch or expand when empty; do not run hot water through it; do not leave hose under pressure with water on if not in use; and keep hose indoors and dry during winter.\"]\n",

Once the water is on, the hose pressurizes, and it is easy to pull it out to expand to the length needed, up to the full length.When I'm finished using it, I turn off the water, keep the spray open to let the water out of the hose, and it practically springs back to a minimal length, and is super-easy to put away!  Awesome!!!My only - minimal - complaint is that when I have it pulled out to my garden, there is always some tension on it, always some pull, pulling it back towards the hose bib.

Oh, to have a hose on hand!!!!But, as anyone knows who owns a hose, they are bulky, heavy and if you are transporting them in your vehicle, they take up a VAST amount of room! So, it was with great interest that I ordered THIS expandable hose, having seen them advertised on TV for years and on the snarkier side, seeing them lying in dirty coils in the trash cans in our alleys.When I received the box, I was immediately impressed with the uber-light weight of \"fifty feet of hose\" and the teeny-tiny box it came packaged inside of. I was also impressed with the very heavy duty brass couplings, since the tossed away hoses I\\'ve seen ALL had cheap plastic couplings.I read the instructions, had the gate valve OFF, slowly allowed the water to expand the hose, and then I waited an additional 10 minutes for the hose to reach maximum length. However, I did have to manually \"extend\" the hose by starting at the faucet and stretching out the wrinkles from the covering, so that it was as close to 50 feet as advertised.How does it work? GREAT, if you have NO HOSE! Also, GREAT if you don\\'t need a standard hose\\'s far more rapid and pressurized volume of water. You will NOT be able to use the Jet setting on your nozzle to power wash your deck or sidewalk. You will NOT be able to fill a 5 gallon bucket very fast. But, for watering some hanging baskets or shrubs or allowing for more time to fill up a pond or bucket, this hose sure beats having NO HOSE!One note of caution: with the wrinkles that are ALWAYS present on the surface of this hose, it catches/snags on the slightest of surfaces in your garden, which may exacerbate the demise of it\\'s lifespan. A normal smooth-surface garden hose glides over flagstone, mulch and gravel; the textured surface of this hose snags on everything! So, when I was using it, I literally had to start at the nozzle and \"walk the hose\" over the entire surface of the job site so I could avoid snagging it and ripping it. And when I drained and coiled it up, I had to end up washing the entire hose off because it picked up all the sand we laid on the patio, making for one messy hose.This may read as a negative review but it\\'s NOT! I\\'d \"give a kidney\" to have a hose in a pinch at a job site and am exceedingly pleased that I can drain and coil this hose up into a shoe-box sized container, to have \"In Case of Emergency\".

I gave it a month to be sure, but no leaks so far.The hose is also very light.  I am not a strong person.  Absolutely not upper body strength.  But I have no trouble at all moving this hose around from place to place in my garden.  The way that it collapses when not in use is very convenient.

It doesn't take but a few seconds for the hose to fill out and stretch to the full length. When the water is turned off, it takes a few seconds as it draws up to about a third of the full size. The hose then can be gathered up to the size of a loaf of bread and it weighs about as much. Not bad for a 50 foot hose with brass fittings. It doesn't take much space to store it, so it would be ideal for campers, boats, etc. Anywhere a hose would be handy to have but space is limited.

You are supposed to follow a specific method for initially operating the hose. Another factor in rating it a 1 is there is no manufacturer contact information included with the hose. None on the box and none in the directions. I also tried to find the manufacturer on the internet and no luck there either.If the hose goes bad, you are simply out of luck. Another concern is that this hose is not to be used for drinking water. Makes me wonder what is leaching out from this hose into the water and worry also about pets or animals drinking water that came out of this hose.

The Rumford came in a much bigger box as it doesn't coil up as small as the ASOTV version. But, that's a good thing because the Rumford is made of better higher quality materials. First off the hose rubber feels thicker and the outer fabric is much better. The fittings are brass and it also has an on off valve on it so if you didn't want to hook up one of those sprayer nozzles you don't have to.The ASOTV version doesn't tell you that you need to slowly turn on the faucet because the pressure will burst it. It also doesn't tell you how much pressure it is rated for whereas the Rumford is rated for 250psi. From my research, i do not think either version likes to stay out in the weather so I recommend that after use, you put it in a shed, garage or some kind go mini storage shed out of the sun as the UV may damage it and lessen the life of the hose.The hose itself is very thin and you won't get the same pressure as a normal garden hose because its just to thin. Its more for watering plants and the quick use especially in off seasons where your main hose is away for the winter. I've used this to wash the car real fast to get the salt off it from the roads since my regular hose was frozen. Its easy to quick connect, use and then disconnect and put in the garage out of the cold and harsh weather.One thing I immediately noticed is that it smells. I guess its the rubber or something but its stinky. Don't drink from it or let the kids do that either, not that you should anyway because of the bacteria...i watch Dr. Oz too much i think..lolFor now its convenient and there's no winding up the hose in one of those crank storage boxes which is the main reason for getting this hose. I seem to curse at the regular hose every time i use it because its difficult to unwind and then rewind because it gets bent and tangled up.

I've bought a number of hoses in my life - and something always happens to the hose to make it worthless. The cheap hoses give you a lot of length for very low cost - but they kink within minutes of unwrapping them from their manufactured packaging. I've spent big money on the high-end hoses that don't kink - but they are so heavy and cumbersome. You have to roll them up - eventually you just leave them out and something happens to bend/crimp the metal end to make them unusable.There are drawbacks to any scenario - including this compact hose. You have to fill it completely (which is kinda fun the first time around) to build up the pressure to expand it before you can start to use it. This isn't the kinda hose you just let trickle while taking a sip at the other end - it's not a pressure washer per se, but you have to have the nozzle on the business end for it to work. When you're done using the hose, you have to let the water get out of it so it can retract to storage size.We live out in the country, so a pile of hose is an invitation for snakes, spiders and other unseemly creatures to huddle. I like that this is so light weight and portable, that I can quickly remove it and put it in storage when it's not in use and its long enough that I can use it just about anywhere in our yard.The fabric will pick up dirt, pollen, etc. - but there are trade offs for any gizmo you get.

Once the hose is filled and expanded, then you can open the valve and use the hose. Maybe my water pressure is not up to this hose's requirements, but the hose shrinks down to about 34 feet during use. It sprays out for a while until it shrinks down, then it turns into a full pressure stream. If I just turn the water on without giving it time to fill up and expand, the full pressure stream comes out and it slowly expands a little, but not to the full length.-While the hose is not fully expanded, it is stretchy. This concerns me as the fittings receive a lot of strain during this. I wish they had made the fittings travel even further up the hose with a long point of contact. I'd feel a lot more confident.-If I have a 50 foot hose, I expect it to be a 50 foot hose - not 50 foot for a few seconds and then 34 foot.It has promise, but maybe this style hose just isn't for me. Maybe my water pressure is not strong enough to maintain the full length during use. My expectation was for the hose to maintain the 50 foot length until I was done and ready to put it up. I'll let it fill up and expand, walk out to my tree to water it, and once I turn the water on, I have to start walking backward as the hose shrinks on me. Convenience lost!\"]\n",

The instructions were clear - very clear - but snapping together some of the pieces was very difficult. I specifically struggled with the wheels; the wheel trim, shown in the image here as yellow - mine were silver, were supposed to be removed before putting on the wheels. Then, you put the wheel trim back in after the wheels were on and snap/push it into place. It was very hard to do that. I also struggled with transport handle; I really had to struggle to get the piece lined up right to get the screws in. I essentially had to bend/shove it into place so I could get it attached.Total time to get this put together: less than 30 mins.The AC cord is plenty long, as is the cord for the trigger gun. The cord for the gun had to be un-looped several times; I can only hope this loosens up in time - it's pretty stiff.When I used this for the first time, there was a weird motor noise that kept happening when I was spraying. It was like the motor was struggling, or tripping - every few seconds. I reset the power and did not experience this problem again. However, there were three other occasions where the power was tripped and I had to reset it. I have no idea why, or if this is normal behavior for this particular unit.There are two wands that come with the unit:1) Vario Power Spray wand2) Dirtblaster (rotary spray wand)The unit is plenty powerful, so no issues there. I tried both wands and found that the Dirtblaster wand was easier to use. I power washed the siding on my house and some pavement. I also accidentally swiped this over my cedar fence and deck - DO NOT DO THAT - it will shred soft wood like that.However, the Dirtblaster wand is supposed to spray in a circular motion - and it did, for a while - but it didn't do that all the time. Sometimes it would spray in a circular motion, sometimes just a straight stream of water. It cleaned just fine either way, but I think something was off about that. In reading the instructions, it says that the Dirtblaster wand is NOT to be used for siding, so don't be like me - read the manual first!Overall, a great power washer!PROS: Very powerful and capable, front lip for holding wand cord, detergent tank, two wands for cleaning of most surfaces, easy to wind AC cord around back.CONS: Heavy.

You can use the adjustable sprayer for focused or low power washing, or you can use the rotating head for a powerful, clean \"sweeping\" action. Both heads worked great and having the adjustable flow was very useful when I used it to wash my car. Typical operation for cleaning the stairs and sidewalk was as expected: move back for a wider, slower spray, move in for a narrower, faster spray. Everything just worked.

On this model you can comfortably use a 4-5 inch spread to achieve the same effect which makes the job much, much faster. At a 1-inch distance the new machine will remove almost anything at all.It's a great machine in its simplicity and power and has reduced my six-monthly pressure washing tasks from 2 hours down to about 30 minutes. It feels like a solid, commercial unit and is definitely the most powerful electric washer I've used.\"]\n",
            " [\"I've gone through a few power washers.  I don't use them often, so I don't get new ones to replace a broken one, just usually I see one and it has a feature I'd like, so I give my old one to a friend or family member, and get the new one.This one looked interesting when it came up in the Vine program, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was winter time when I ordered it, and living in Wisconsin with the winter we've had, I've got so much salt in the garage that I've never seen it look like this before.  In about a 2 foot oval around the entire area the car sits, it's like a small white beach, there are literally small salt dunes in many places.This was probably the biggest pain of any I have purchased to unbox and put together.  There are 19 pieces you pull out, 21 if you count the two wheel covers that were slipped on the wheels but not fully in place yet, and had to be removed to put the wheels on anyway.  Some things didn't line up very easily and required a bit of force to get them into place, and this was mostly due to the barrels the screws went through not going into the holes set in the receiving piece without a bunch of elbow grease and slightly bending things to align them.  There's a little design quality there they could improve upon.I don't like that the connector for the hose is all plastic.  Plastic for the screw threads, plastic for the little rollers that pop out to secure it to the nozzle on the power washer, just plastic plastic plastic.  I've had far too many of these break in the past from other manufacturers. I also don't like the wand's connector.  The hose from the washer to the wand actually slides up inside a deep recessed hole with a cover totally shrouding it.  The hose has to line up a specific way, because of the shape of the plug on it, and there is no marking on the hose to show &#34;line up with this spot&#34; on the wand.  So you have to look into the &#34;tunnel&#34; on the hose to the hole inside, see where the parts are supposed to be lined up, then get the hose oriented this way, and then push it up inside while maintaining that orientation.  Slightly cocking it to one side or the other will mean you won't get it inserted.  So there's some give and take there.  Most places just use round retaining flanges that can be inserted regardless, but this one is rectangular, so it HAS to go in the right way.I was able to do a good stress test of the unit for my first run though, cleaning out that aforementioned garage full of salt and gunk from the winter roads here.  Since we've had an insanely brutal winter compared to normal for the last couple decades, between more snow and more days below zero, we've used a LOT of salt on our roads.  Now that we're in April, and I finally saw a day break 50 degrees, I thought I would finally clean my garage.  Since I didn't even have hoses outside yet, and the faucets outside are still turned off, I bought a short 15 foot hose to run from my wash tub in the laundry room off my garage to the power washer, and just snaked the hose through the garage door and left it open.Once I got past the reset safety on the plug, I saw that it had apparently been shipped in the &#34;on&#34; position.  It's a large 3&#34; or so circle on the BOTTOM of the front of the washer that rotates to turn this on and off.  I like the large oversized swtich, I just don't like the position.  So I got it going, and spent some time working on the concrete floor in my garage.It performed very well, as good as any power washer I've had in the past, and actually better than most.  On/Off with the wand's handle was quick and flawless.  I know my stationary tub does not put out as much water as quickly when compared to the hose bibs outside.  I've had other power washers when, using something with less than &#34;full water&#34; flow like I was using today, would kind of squirt out a little water until you released the handle on the wand, pulled it, released it, and pulled it again, getting enough water pressure to the pump again, and finally the pump would kick in again and it would start actually using power.  I've had that happen here previously using this very stationary tub.  But it never happened once with this unit.  Full power the entire time despite the lesser inflow of water to the unit.Noise levels were about on par with any power washer I've ever owned.  The hose straightened out easily when I &#34;unscrewed&#34; it by twisting the wand to get rid of all the spirals in it from being rolled up, it didn't try to hold it's old &#34;wound&#34; position like many do.  The hose seems to be better than most of the really bad plastic feeling hoses the other washers I've had used.The wand twists to give you control over the size of the spray, and there's a setting for using the detergent mixer as well.  That was another piece of this that just disappointed me as far as the poor engineering.  The instructions show clearly that you are supposed to run the line from the top back of the power washer to the detergent container underneath the handle where this snaps in.  But if you do that, it would kink the unit.  going to the side wasn't a good option either.  I ended up pulling the little line apart and feeding it through one of the other cutouts in the handle, since that way it wasn't compressed and didn't interfere with getting the container on and off.  I've posted a couple pictures of what I'm talking about so you can see what I mean.I also miss the wind up crank my other one had, since there was a hose reel built into the top of it.  But ultimately I prefer this one since as I said, the hose doesn't seem to be forcing itself to stay in a coiled up spiral shape, I can actually get this completely straight and flat while I'm using it.  I find that far more useful than an easy way to roll it up when I'm done.The AC cord has plenty of length, and the hose is a usable length as well.All told, this is a good little unit.  Engineering issues would've made me give this just 3 stars most likely if it performed as adequately as the other power washers I've used in the past, but I had to give it another star for how well it actually worked.  It had no problems stripping the gunk off my concrete floor, or the Weathertech floor mats of my Jeep, or even the floor mats I dragged outside to hose down now that the winter season has mostly passed us up.  If it weren't for how the hose has to line up just the right way without being able to visually see it while you do it for the connector to the wand, or the assembly issues with things not lining up right before you screwed them in, the performance would've earned this 5 stars.  So it balances out to 4, and it's certainly earned all of them.\"]\n",
            " [\"I was thrilled to be given the opportunity to use and review this item! We have a deck that requires frequent cleaning because we have bird feeders, and truth be told they are too close to the deck - so the deck gets icky, and I hate it!My husband has a power washer, but it is an older model that looks very impressive and requires more muscle than I have in order to move it. He kept telling me he would  show me how to use it, but when using this Karcher power washer became a possibility I was thrilled that I would have a power washer of my own, and, best of all perhaps, in a size that I could manage.I only really used the vario-speed wand. The &#34;dirt-blaster&#34; wand offers seriously strong power, power, washing capability, and it would easily tackle your yuckkiest cleaning task. I  hesitated to try to use the dirt blaster on the siding of the house bcause the 'vario-speed' wand did a perfect job (at a lower than max speed), and I have a feeling that the dirt-blasting wand would take off all of the paint on the siding in a hurry!Fllowing are the pros and con of setting up and using this mighty little power cleaner.Pros:1.  This relatively petite unit does a wonderful job!I got my deck cleaned  (and it was very gunky after a large part of the winter) in no time! I used the vario-speed handle and it was perfect. Even with the relatively poor water pressure that we have at our house, I got a v-e-r-y powerful amount of pressure. Using the vario-speed handle at full pressure blasted bird bath ick in a flash and then, by changing the pressure, let me fill the bird bath easily. It blasted the seeds and gunk that were stuck in between the decking effortlessly! That was really important because I had been having to use a machete knife to clean out in between the decking boards before, which was time cosuming and very discomforting for me.2.  It's portable and the low 30# weight makes it easy to move about as needed.3.  The cords are generously long, I had no problems at all covering a large area without the need to move the unit itself.4.  Because of its compact size, this Karcher power cleaner is easy to cover and store.5.  Having the 'cleaning solution' cannister option makes washing your car so easy! Just add the solution to the cannister, attach the siphon hose and voila - you have your own little car-ash (or patio furniture washer etc.). It's a very handy feature of the unit.6.  With the exception of the banging the wheels in place, I was able to put the unit together by myself. Putting the hoses into place is easy enough and the unit performs flawlessly and easily.Cons:1.  As others have mentioned, the instructions for the assembly are not very good. They took a lot of reading, and re-reading to make sense to me. I got it, however, it just took a bit of time, and, for a change, I really did need to actually r-e-a-d the instructions.2.  The wheels were especially difficult to set, and this is the one thing that I did need to ask my husband for help with. His muscle power was needed to get the wheels pushed in.3.  The wheels are not very effective in general. They help, but they are v-e-r-y stiff and turn all that well.4.  The handle is not very comfortable. I wish that you keep the flow going without having to hold in the handle constantly. I can live with it though. The handle itself is not ergonomic and, as a person who has already had carpal tunnel surgery once, I would have appreciated a better design for the handle and more padding! I plan to construct some sort of cushioning for myself. If you have no issues with your hands or wrists, then this will be no issues for you!5.  The yellow part of the front of the unit that holds the &#34;cleaning solution&#34; cannister is a bit flimsy, and does not attach as securaly to the unit as I would like.Yes, there are quite a few small things that I consider to be 'cons', but the fact of the matter is that this power washer is really perfect for me, and I am thrilled to have it. I will be using it a lot I know. I am so happy that I will not have to master the monster machine that is my husband's old model power washer!For me the pros of this washer make the cons seem like small things. For the money, I truly don't think that you can do any better. I think that the cons are all 'doable'. I took one star off because of the handle design. That's really the only thing I plan to fiddle with to make more comfortable. Those people who experience no hand or wrist problems will have no issues with the handle!This little powerhouse is an excellent value all-in-all and I think that it will be a very useful tool for anyone who needs a good power washer at a very reasonable price point!\"]\n",
            " ['I was looking for an electric pressure washer for home use after having had a lot of success with an AR Blue Clean AR383 that I had purchased for work.  When I saw this unit I thought I would give it a try.  Here is what I like:1.  The pressure hose is fairly flexible and the power cord is very flexible.  These may seem like small items, but it they are stiff and difficult to work with it can turn a quick task into a real pain.2.  The motor in this unit works well and it seems to create a good amount of pressure.3.  The bright yellow color makes it difficult to trip over!!4.  Only one tool, a number two Philips screwdriver, is required for assembly.5.  The gun assembly on this unit has a much better attachment mechanism for the pressure hose than the AR383 does.Here is what I did not like as much:1.  As opposed to the AR Blue Clean AR383, this unit requires a lot of time to put together!  Allow yourself an hour to assemble this unit as the parts do NOT fit well.  Be especially careful when putting the top section on to the body of the unit as it does NOT go together easily.  The plastic parts do NOT align well and it will take quite a bit of force to get them to fit together (the top slides into the bottom section, if you apply sufficient amount of force) and if you are not careful you can wind up with a pinched hand or finger!!!2.  As opposed to the AR Blue Clean AR383, the ergonomics, fit, and finish of this machine leaves a lot to be desired.  As an example, on the AR383 the handle is finished on all sides.  This makes for a very comfortable grip when you move the unit or if you have to lift it up.  On the Karcher unit, the handled is only finished on the top and forward facing side.  The back of the unit is open plastic that is VERY rough on your hands and not very comfortable.3.  While the wheels of this unit are larger than those on the AR383, they are basically worthless.  They do NOT roll without a lot of force because the wheels have no real support.  There is no shaft that they are connected to.  They are attached to the body of the unit with a press fit piece of plastic that is not stable.  So, the wheels may roll if there is no weight on them, but apply weight and the plastic bends and the wheels rub on the unit or just do not turn.  Since these wheels are plastic, expect them to wear out quickly due to sliding and not turning on surfaces.4.  The quick disconnect is a joke.  It is a VERY frail piece of plastic that does not connect well.  I had mine disconnect twice while the unit was in use (happened when I shut off the spray).  I would highly recommend buying a higher quality connector because if this comes disconnected while the pump is running you can ruin the motor since it is basically water cooled and water lubricated.Overall, this unit is functional and does work as long as you are either very careful with the quick disconnect or if you replace it with a decent one.  However, I do not see where it delivers a $100 worth of higher performance of gives value for the money you need to spend over and above what an AR Blue Clean AR383 gives you.The two star deduction is for Value, quality of fit and finish, and lousy wheels.I would Not recommend this unit.']\n",
            " [\"I love Karcher's pressure washers. They are quality PWs that deliver depending upon your needs. For my needs, the best PW is the Karcher G 2650 gas-powered Honda engine pressure washer. This 2,000 psi electric pressure washer is, by comparison, almost a toy. But to be fair, it's a nice, light, easy to use little thing. If you just want to wash the car and spray some dirt from a small porch, it may be perfect for you. By contrast, my pressure washing needs are significant. I live with a lot of animals and a lot of hard, exterior surfaces and everything gets dusty or muddy by turns. A good, powerful pressure washer is essential unless I want to spend half a day hosing down sidewalks, patios, and driveway. My gas-powered Karcher gets the job done FAST. This little electric unit is hardly more powerful than my garden hose turned full force and equipped with a good pistol grip spray nozzle. And there are all those hoses to move thither and yon. Admittedly only one more hose than the gas-powered washer has, but for me with all the space I have to cover, it's the hose that broke this camel's back. To its credit, the Karcher 2,000 psi electric is easier to start, easier to lift, and more convenient to power. So, if your need is for a relative lightweight, it likely will do the job. But don't be misled, if you've got a lot of ground (concrete, stone, etc.) to cover, you may need what I need, the Karcher 2,650 psi gas-powered model.\"]\n",
            " [\"There were two problems, one a big hassle and one insurmountable.  First: it was hard to get the device put together.  The instructions were clear enough.  The problem was more that the machining had virtually no tolerance, and it thus required a lot of hand strength at several points to get the thing put together.  Second: though the electrical ground fault tester indicated that there was not a problem and though we tried plugging the device into several different outlets, we could not get the motor to turn on.  We followed all the fail safe hints and suggestions.  But: no go.We will try taking the device over to the more modern house of friends to see whether the problem is a function of our old house and old electrical service or something in the device itself.  But...in either case....we're most unlikely to wind up a power washer that works and can actually be used for jobs we need it for.\"]\n",
            " [\"A trimmer that's really light weight, mows, and is cordless? Fantastic! But...when it works it's great....but it's getting it to work that is the tricky part. It is so light weight that it's great for tiny yards, steep hillsides, or for the elderly or younger kids to use. It's a less dangerousness mini mower with the deck on. You just make sure the lithium battery is completely locked in, push a button and squeeze the handle. As an edger it works well too but with no shields attached watch out for your bare ankles getting hit by debris.The problems: let's start with the battery's. Each battery only lasts 15-20 minutes tops depending upon grass length. So if you have any sizable job it would take you forever to get it done. Especially since each battery then takes about 4 and a half hours to recharge. So 9 hours of charging for 30-40 minutes of work time. Out of the box my husband and I used this as a mower. We each used both batteries once, so there was a recharge between uses. Then I went to recharge the batteries only to get the flashing red light signal that indicated overheating. We tried this off and on for over 24 hours plugging the charger in inside the house. Finally I emailed Black and Decker who responded with a statement that I should be charging them in a cool area ( it was mid May and our house was no warmer than 71) but that since I had a time period I needed to review this in I could take it to their service center an hour away. We went out of our way to get there to be told that this was a known battery problem, they were in a minor redesign and we would have new batteries in about ten days. The new ones finally came- and still when we went to charge them the same overheat signal came on and the batteries wouldn't charge. So another trip to the service center where they finally decided it was the fault of the charger. A new one was ordered. But a second set of batteries showed up instead. So those then had to be mailed back and wait for the charger some more. Now that the waiting game is over the trimmer/ mower is great as long as it has that tiny amount of juice but from my perspective this product still needs a lot of work to make it better for the user.\"]\n",

I have many pieces of equipment including a large ride-on mower, a self-propelled push mower, and a walk behind heavy duty weed eater (gas powered, but not self propelled.These pieces of equipment are all great for various uses, but the one thing that I had trouble with was a large section of my front yard that is on a steep incline where none of the other equipment could be easily or safely used. When we tried the other equipment, we would end up with large ruts which would then end up leading to erosion of the hillside where the grass had been torn up.This little piece of equipment was perfect. It is very light weight and the lithium battery packs will allow for a decent amount of mowing/trimming, especially if you have both packs fully charged. I love the mower desk as it enabled me to more easily do large sections than if I had to use it as a regular weed whacker.It seems fairly high quality for the price.

If there are narrow lengths of grass to cut or if there is only a little bit of grass to cut on a flat surface, the mower attachment could be handy.On the other hand, I found that my quite uneven grass required me to use the trimmer without the mower attachment. The trimmer is not heavy. The trick, if there is one, is to keep the trigger pulled while going back and forth over the area getting trimmed.The mower attachment is easy to clean - can be hosed down. I use up a battery is a LOT less than half an hour, maybe because I'm holding the trigger the whole time.The continuous line feed helps a lot. Also, I like that replacement line is not overly priced.\"]\n",
            " [\"Having used gas trimmers, and both corded and cordless trimmers over the years, I was very impressed with how lightweight this trimmer is, and the power and battery life it has. With its 2 batteries and tiny toy mower attachment, you could get away without a mower if you have a cute little postage stamp yard.I have Black & Decker's previous cordless electric trimmer, the 18V Grass Hog, and it is, frankly, awful. After a few disappointing uses (it's heavier, weaker, and with a shorter battery life and even longer charging time than this trimmer), it got put aside and we switched back to the gas trimmer (or, more accurately, I quit trimming altogether when my partner's away, as I hate the noise, smell, weight, difficulty starting and intense vibrations of the gas trimmer).I've used this trimmer all over our property, for standard lightweight edging of a maintained lawn, for crisis &#34;mowing&#34; of a severely overgrown (tall grass and heavy weeds) large courtyard, and for trimming paths around water and fences in tallgrass pasture. I've used the little &#34;mower&#34; attatchment on both high and normal grass. It's great on regular grass, workable on overgrown.It's great. Light as-is, easy on your back, hands and shoulders. Doesn't require a kung-fu grip to start or keep on, and with the mower attachment, it weighs nothing and you can operate it with one hand with the same effort you'd need to run an ultralight vacuum.I like that it comes with 2 batteries and uses the same battery as other B&D; tools in the same line (I had another battery from a little cordless chainsaw we got for Christmas). I found all 3 batteries to have the following life:-20 minutes on light edging--what you have around the edges if you mow every week-15 minutes on taller grass and heavy trimming (medium weeds, mid-calf-high grass)-10 minutes on every heavy weed and tough, stemmy pasture grass over the kneesIf you let your big, tough weeds get to your waist (which is true on much of our property, which includes a lot of pasture woods), or you have woody weed and vines, this trimmer is going to have trouble. But then, I don't think any trimmer's going to do well with stems an inch around.The one negative is that the batteries do take a long time to charge--4+ hours each, and there's just one charger. We have a charging station where we keep all our tool and regular  batteries charged and ready to go, so it wasn't a problem for me, but would have been in the days before we had our little dedicated charging area. B&D; does make a fast charger (40 minutes--http://www.amazon.com/Black-Decker-L2ACF-OPE-Lithium-Charger/dp/B009NOCWY6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1403104470&sr;=8-1&keywords;=black+and+decker+20v+lithium+charger) that I will probably nab in the future.All in all, I was well pleased to have an edger that did a good job, had sufficient battery life for all our normal trimming, and didn't leave my back aching or my hands numb.\"]\n",

I especially appreciate that it comes with two batteries.  We've never had to wait to use the trimmer because of this (but just one of the batteries typically lasts us through a couple of lawn sessions).  It's also handy that the charger is a trickle charger; you can leave the battery on there so it's always ready to go, and you don't have to worry about ruining it by overcharging it.  The batteries can be used interchangeably with other B&D; products that use 20-volt batteries.The mowing deck is easy to use and, with it, you can do an adequate job of mowing your lawn.  It would be perfect for tiny yards or remote patches that you don't want to lug your full-size mower to.  It would also be great for anyone who needs their mower to be lightweight.  Otherwise, you're really going to be better off with a mower.

            " ['-- UPDATE#2 --Well after taking it for a complete spin around our yard, two batteries are definitely needed. I was able to achieve 20-30 minutes max. After about half way the power started to drop and we had to swap batteries to complete the job. Keep in mind this was only string trimming around 1500 linear feet of edging (approximately). This is definitely not going to replace my Tanaka string trimmer, but I\\'ll grab it in a pinch to do some quick trimming or touchups.-- UPDATE#1 --Quick tip for people using it as a mower, it\\'s best if you mow like you would vacuum (back and forth). That and mow a bit more often than you normally would to prevent it from getting bogged down.Also, I highly recommend usingGrez-Offto clean the mower deck and trimmer with after every use as it removes every bit of pulverized grass with ease.Right off the bat assembly and getting the trimmer adjusted was easy and straight forward. Just a single screw was required to get the guard in place and it was ready to go.After charging one of the batteries for a few hours (as required), it was time to take it for a spin. Nice and quiet operation, plenty of power to cut down 12\"+ grass with ease. With the adjustable telescoping handle I was able to get it to fit me as well as my shorter family members.The single button adjustable grip handle allows for a great amount of control and again was able to get it into a position that fit my trimming needs.The 20V battery seems to be holding quite well and gives me plenty of run time to complete our 1/3 acre lot (will update this review as to any changes in the battery charge/run time).Now as for the mower... it has got to be a joke. This would only be useful for someone who lives in the city and only has to take care of a patch or two of sidewalk grass every week.The height adjustment is lacking and clumsy.The \"mower deck\" on the bottom is just cram packed with nooks, crannies, and areas where grass gets packed in making it harder to clean.The only thing that the deck portion has that is useful, is a ring for hanging it when not in use (something I wish the trimmer had...).So if you have a small patch of grass (or two) to upkeep, this will definitely help you out. However if you have a bit more land to mow, buy just the trimmer because it\\'s awesome!']\n",

The batteries were so huge that it really weighed down the handle and my arm would sometimes be sore by the time I finished the yard.  The batteries also didn't last more than 10-15 minutes and the power level would sometimes get lost when in storage in between each job.  I like this model much more because of the lithium batteries.  The product is much easier to hold for longer periods of time, and it seems more powerful than even the 24v model.  It also lasts longer.  I haven't had a job last more than 20 minutes and the battery lasts the entire time, whereas the 24v version would take two batteries to finish the job.  It is nice that this version comes with two batteries as well.The mower attachment is a neat little idea.  It makes trimming larger areas much easier because you don't have to hold up the entire trimmer the whole time and because you get a more level cut.  It has two cutting levels and it is easy to attach and detach the trimmer to it.I'm much happier with this model than I was with the 24v version with the huge batteries.  It makes the work much easier.\"]\n",
            " [\"First off - I live in the south and we have St. Augustine grass - when using this as a mower, even assuming you want to mow your yard 12 inches at a time, this is too short even at the highest setting for St. Augustine grass.  Maybe if you have bermuda or some other variety it might do the trick for tiny yards.As a weed whacker, again, I have to say it is so so.  This is a lightweight yard tool - the batteries are small and it really feels under-powered to me, but I am used to using a 36volt li-ion trimmer that can go thru absolutely anything i throw it at.  For the first edging of the season, you'll have a really hard time getting a nice clean line with this tool. This tool, while a clever design, is really only suitable for small yards that are consistently maintained.  The only thing I can really say that I like about it, is the edger guide, which goes against the sidewalk to guide not just placement, but also depth, the guide has a little bump out that sits on top of the sidewalk so that you aren't going down too deep and wasting a bunch of trimmer line.I have always like black and decker yard products because they are light enough and sized appropriately for a small woman to do her own yard work - a big plus in my book, and this tool is no exception. However, putting the guard on during first assembly out of the box was unreasonably difficult - I couldn't get it to snap into place no matter how hard I pushed.

Why should it  be so difficult to put together that I have to ask my husband for help?Once you get past that difficulty, the rest of this product is dead simple to use and nice and lightweight.

            " [\"This is a clever idea - if you have a certain type of little &#34;yard&#34; you are familiar with trying to mow it with a string trimmer.  Sometimes you overswing into the adjoining plants, sometimes you kick up a divot...  But what if you could just slot the trimmer into a wheeled frame that would keep it level, maybe height-adjustable?  Voila!Of course you're not covering as much grass as a blade-mower: you're limited to the length of the string.  That's a max cutting radius of 6&#34; here, though I guess beyond that the string would be kicking around anyway.  And in this case it's lithium-battery powered, which is what it is - currently about 15 minutes a charge (new battery...)  However it's LOTS lighter than any reel mower I've ever carried, easier to use, more effective, and far more convenient to store.For my old &#34;yard,&#34; a cascade of little terraces on an urban slope, this would've been PERFECT.  For my current yard, which is convenient to external outlets, corded would be better, and cheaper in the long run.  But on the whole, this has been very useful so far.  It all depends on how long the MTC220, its batteries (and the string) lasts.\"]\n",
            " [\"If you're using it as a trimmer, it's great. For smaller lawns, in fact, it's almost perfect. The only thing I would fault is that using it as an edger has it's drawbacks. It's not as powerful as a plug-in trimmer or a gas trimmer so you really need to keep up with the edging. Also, when twisting it into edging mode I have two issues. First, the wire metal guide is difficult and frustrating to pull out. The old B&D model has one that just flips out which is much better. Second, as you twist the end to put it into edger mode the metal rod tends to come completely loose. With my small lawn this trimmer's battery lasts more than long enough. It just doesn't have the power of a plug in model so expect that before you buy. If you were using this to clear the edge of a field with tall weeds I'd say look at something else. For grass this is fine. For weeds you'd have a struggle.. The mower part of this is just a gimmick. I cannot understand, unless you had a lawn for ants, how this would make a good mower. I gave it a good try but it's super-frustrating to use. If you don't have a mower it's best to mow using it like a trimmer than to hook it up to this silly contraption. I'd give this a full five stars but the goofiness of the mower attachment and the other items knock one star off.\"]\n",
            " ['My upfront summary - a good mower that cuts my grass quite well, the grass catcher works okay but not perfectly, and the cord wasn\\'t nearly as difficult to keep out of the way as I had expected.  If you have the ability to get a cord out to everywhere you want to cut grass, I think this is worth considering.  Larger lawns can also benefit if you want to avoid gas because you won\\'t run out of juice when you have it plugged in versus running off of a battery.  It\\'s not perfect, it\\'s a little bulky compared to what I\\'m used to, and the handle height isn\\'t adjustable (on mine, even though the pictures on Amazon show it is) - so if it doesn\\'t fit you, you\\'re out of luck.  If you\\'re still interested :), I have more details below.Living in the desert, I have a smaller lawn that is about 600 square feet (around 20 by 30 feet).  So, definitely not a huge lawn.  Even so, I\\'ve put off buying a corded electric mower for years because I thought it would be a real hassle to deal with a power cord, and I thought the risk of slipping up and slicing the cord with the mowing blade were too high.  I always gravitated to wanting a battery-based model, but those have their own issues (heavier, can\\'t mow if you forgot to charge the battery, batteries only last so long).  After growing up in Illinois and using a gas mower for many years, I just don\\'t want one of those.  After reviewing the directions, I saw that B&D; had a diagram showing the recommended mowing pattern to make it easier to keep the cord out of the way - and it worked great for me!  Probably common sense, but I was so used to the way that I\\'d always mowed my lawn, it hadn\\'t occurred to me to do it that way.  So, if you get one, check out the directions - it made using a cord a lot easier for me, and it alleviated a lot of the hassles that I had expected to encounter.There are a variety of mowers out there: gas, electric with cords, electric with batteries, and push reel.  I\\'d like to compare this to a push reel because for fourteen years, I\\'ve been using a reel mower much like thisAmerican Lawn Moweron Amazon.  Most reel mowers aren\\'t fancy, but they can cost under $100, take up very little floor space, and work quite well if you don\\'t let your grass get too long.  What mine doesn\\'t do, but you can buy models that do, is catch the grass clippings.  What this B&D; brings to the table versus my reel mower is a much more even cut, it catches the grass, and it handles long (higher than 6\") grass with ease.  The end result is a cleaner looking lawn.  The drawbacks are it takes a lot more floor space in my garage, it\\'s heavier and bulkier so it\\'s more difficult to carry around to my lawn (I don\\'t wheel it because the rest of my yard is rock), and it takes longer to get started because I have to get the cord all set up and in place.In the end, I really like the more consistent cut and reduced mowing effort from this B&D; versus my reel mower, but I might like even better the smaller footprint in my garage and reduced time it takes from start to finish with the reel mower.  So, for those of you with smaller lawns, I recommend that you at least consider a reel mower - but for those of you looking at corded mowers, I do recommend giving this model your consideration.  If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment and I\\'ll respond as quickly as I can.Pros:(*) It\\'s a Black & Decker.  I\\'ve purchased a number of their electric lawn care items (blower/vac, pole saw, chain saw), and I\\'ve overall been happy with the build quality of them.  This mower is no exception(*) Handles long (at least six inches) grass with no problems(*) Very even and consistent cut(*) Super easy (and I mean super) change between cutting lengths.  I can\\'t get over just how effortless it is to move the lever and adjust it.  I love it(*) Decently quiet.  Kind of like a hair dryer.  Louder than my reel mower, but by no means painfully or annoyingly loud(*) Safety bar on the handle will turn on blade if you let go of the handle(*) Fairly lightweight for a mower, given the extensive use of plastics(*) Has a built-in cord loop on the lower handle to store your extension cord right on the mower.  If you have a spare cord to use just with this mower, that is a very handy feature(*) Won\\'t run out of power because it\\'s cordedCons:(*) The vent holes all around the grass box let a lot of dust and dry clippings out.  The box does catch most of the grass, but it spits out a good deal of small particles(*) The handle on mine only had one set of holes, so the height is not adjustable.  It fits my height (5\\'9\") okay, but I\\'d like to be able to adjust it lower.  If you\\'re shorter than me, this might be a problem(*) Takes up a lot more floor space in the garage than my upright reel mower, so finding a place for it was more difficult.  Not a con if you\\'ve got plenty of room or are replacing another similarly-sized mower(*) It\\'s always attached to a power cord.  Yep, that\\'s both a pro and a con :)Notes:(*) It comes mostly assembled, which is nice, but getting it all together might take a little patience.  Putting the grass box together was a real pain for me.  The dark plastic halves aren\\'t overly rigid, but you need to get a number of tabs lined up and snapped into place - which isn\\'t easy when the halves are flexing and moving the tabs out of alignment.  One of my tabs was out of alignment, but I eventually got it massaged into place using a screwdriver.  It took much longer than I had expected.  Once done, though, it\\'s easy to insert and remove the grass box from the main mower.  Also, one of the screws to get the handle attached took some doing to get it to catch the threads on the recessed hole']\n",

            " ['** updated with second mow at bottom**I really do enjoy mowing my yard... it\\'s a little more than  1/3 acre and a push mower is good exercise.  My other mower is a 13 year old Toro Recycler 22\" deck with personal pace self-propelled drive.  I\\'ve kept that gas engine purring and it\\'s still running strong - Briggs and Stratton make a good engine.  But... it is loud (I mow with ear buds or plugs in) and it\\'s considered not as \"green\" as some current options.  So even though I\\'m a happy Toro gas mower owner... I thought I\\'d give an electric a chance.A quick pros and cons for the start here...  remember that I\\'ve only assembled and mowed once with it....+ Very light - this is a mower my 6 year old could handle (and no... I don\\'t let her mow).+ packaged mostly assembled - only two Philips head screws to anchor the handle.  The rest is tool-less.+ Significantly quieter than my gas engine mower.  I don\\'t have a SPL gauge, but I can mow without protection and wouldn\\'t get a headache-  17\" deck is a bit narrow.  It sure fits in the garage easy, but I\\'m adding an additional swipe after every 3 passes to keep up with my 22\" gas mower.  Will be a bit more exercise... and a lawn pattern with more wheel marks.-  Not self-propelled... perhaps this is an observation more than a Con...  It\\'s light, so it doesn\\'t feel like it needs a drive system-  Mostly plastic construction - long term durability?-  Wheels seem less rugged than ones designed for steel deck mowers.Now that we are past the bullets...  Assembly...well the handle attaches with two screws and the upper handle with two tool-less bolts with a hand side wingnuts... they all work well and provide a study feel when complete.The fancy plastic grass catcher comes in 4 pieces...  that\\'s right... 4!  I spent more time inserting tab A into slot B than should be necessary.  The grass catcher is a work of functional art.  Two tone, with a compactor arm built into the unit.  It\\'s a great concept in lawn tech.  I have some concerns over the long term strength over the 4 piece unit versus a molded one piece.  Time will tell if those tabs maintain their strength.  Some additional concerns are the weight.  The plastic catching unit is obviously heftier than a fabric catcher and when full and compacted with grass -- It\\'s likely going to be a lot heavier than the motor deck.  The first spring mow was more of a top off cut than a normal full cut, so I didn\\'t get to witness if the lack of weight in the mower deck and the ability to compact a lot of grass in this catcher turn into a big negative in keeping an even cut through less than ideal slightly bumpy terrain.From a grass catching perspective, it appeared to have less of a \"suction\" than my Toro gas unit.  It would go over leaves without pulling them up into the catcher,  perhaps this will improve when the height of the grass increases, but it\\'s a noticeable different to the gas mower.  Mowing without the catcher in place is possible, but doesn\\'t produce a mulching action when doing a light cut - I will check this again when the grass is higher for the next cut.The front edge of the mower has a molded handle built into the unit.  I\\'m really not sure of why it\\'s there - the top handle makes more sense.  But with garage space a premium, it looks a great place to use a hook and pulley to pull this mower up and hang it on the wall like my other electric yard tools...  unlike a gas engine; I don\\'t have to worry about it spilling out oil or gas...The height of the mower is changed using a single handle adjustment behind the rear left wheel (its orange in the picture).  When the mower is raised and lowered, the cut gauge on the side reads out in inches...  I think it\\'s great that it is simplified to not have to move each wheel to change height.  Much more user friendly.  My only concern with this method of raising the cut is that it is only raising the back end of the mower to achieve this height, putting the cutting blade at an angle.  This isn\\'t as much of an issue on the grass in the middle of the cut, but the edge cuts won\\'t be at the same even height due to the blade angle.  I don\\'t yet have full enough grass to check the impact of raising it all the way up to 3\"...  but I\\'m interested in hearing others experiences with cut quality due to this function.The blade had a factory edge on it, which is normal for all mowers...  I\\'ll be giving it a 90 degree sharp edge before the next mow...Handling... I\\'m used to a heavy mower, doing a little bit of \"Tokyo Drifting\" with a self-propelled unit to slide into the end cuts and radius cuts.  The much lighter deck of this unit is definitely a different feel and seems easy to lift the mower off of its cut angle/depth.  I had to consciously change the way I\\'m putting pressure on the handle to keep the deck down in walking turns.The balance of the mower feels a little off...  with very little weight in the electric engine and deck and the handle being attached over the rear wheels,  the additional weight of the catcher (especially when full) makes it unbalanced causing the front wheels to easily rise on a bumpy area...  This leads to an uneven cut.  Moving the handle attachment an inch or two forward of the rear wheels should make this tool feel more stable and cut more uniformly.And the biggest difference between gas and electric... the cord.  I\\'ve used electric dethatchers and other devices in which you have to be cord conscious, so it didn\\'t cause me too much issue.  But it is a significant consideration in how you mow versus a gas (cordless) mower.  Your mowing pattern has to be cord friendly... and your cord needs to be long enough to support your mowing swipes.  Cord management adds time to the mowing cycle, and even though it was out of the way most of the time, cords get caught up in my shrubs and plants, requiring adept lasso maneuvers to prevent walking to move a cord.Summary?  It\\'s okay.  It may be durn perfect for a very small yard - but that\\'s not my yard.  Even with a light early spring cut, it took enough time additional to the gas mower that it was noticeable - But that\\'s really to be expected when you are dealing with a thinner deck 17\" vs 22\" and power cord management.  The jury is still out on the cut quality - I will add to the review as the grass thickens up.  But the height adjustment angled method is concerning me.  The unit is quieter and gives me green \"street cred\"  if you ignore the fact that Ohio power comes from burning coal...  I\\'ll improve this review as I continue to use the unit this next month.  For now the Gas Toro mower is still hibernating.******Second mow this week at 3\"...  The grass grew like the preferred weed that it is last week with all of the rain.  This time i added a 25\\' extension cord to my 50\\' cord to prevent unexpected loss of power from ripping it out of the socket.  That seemed to make my range much more acceptable in swipes across the yard.In the much thicker grass, the lack of a drive engine and the plasticy light nature of the unit made it more difficult to keep a nice clean line. I may just be used to the control of the Toro that makes this easier - I\\'ll mark it off to my lack of skill , but my lines were not very pretty.  Although I could hear the engine audibly bogging a little with the grass cut, the cut seemed clean and the catcher was doing its job.  I could not visibly tell while standing if the cut was uneven due to the height mechanism angling the blade, but getting down to the level of the grass low on my knees, it was visible.  So this mower will not have a straight even cut at max height...  that being said, at that height, such unevenness is hard to detect -- which is the compromise the engineers took for the ease of height adjustment.  At the lower height settings, the blade lowers to level, making a low cut the most even it accomplishes..  when it is the most noticeable.After mowing with it for about an hour, doing the cable dance, and emptying the unit several times... I finally returned to my Toro recycler.  Checked its oil, added gas, primed... and on the first pull it started right up, as if 6 months of dormancy never happened..  I finished the yard faster with the gas mower.So why did I give up?  As I was concerned the B&D; deck is too light.  When the heavy plastic grass catcher was just 3/4 full, it was so heavy that it could not even sit on its own four wheels due to being off balance.  It would fall back and rest on the grass catcher.  This lack of weight down on the front end of the mower leads to an uneven cut due to the front end bouncing, and me always pushing down the front to keep it cutting the grass.It\\'s now hanging on the wall on my garage as a backup if my main mower has issues - but my recommendation is that this unit would only be best for those with very small yards and a willingness to deal with an evolving design that hasn\\'t yet been perfected... to avoid having the maintenance and fuel requirements of a gas mower.']\n",

It represents quite a set of changes from mowers in the past:1) Lightweight, low profile and great handle bar. This mower weighs only 32 pounds because of its many plastic parts including the wheels. The bar is steel, making it easy to maneuver.2) Low profile and easy single lever height adjustment. The product photos barely do it justice in terms of showing the low profile. It's better to have a low profile for getting under shrubs. It also makes it feel like an edger when edging. The height adjustment allows selection of the cut from 11/10&#34; to 31/10&#34;.3) The bale switching compacts grass clippings and allows more grass to be collected between emptying. That saves time and effort.4) Comes with 2 year limited warranty. Several action may cause the warranty to be voided, such as changing the wheel size.5) B & D recommends that when the mower is off and unplugged, that the blades be wiped with a damp cloth.

Unfortunately the push mower, while it could be powered this way, would probably require a decent bank of batteries, adding weight and cost.

Now if you have a small yard, and don't want to handle the mess and maintenance of a gas powered lawn mower, or just concerned about weight, a plug in lawn mower might be a good choice for you.  The cord is a pain, and speaking of that, make sure you have one, since they don't include an extension cord with it.Black & Decker have always been more on the 'value' side when it comes to quality, and while there are some good features, it feels the quality is a bit lacking.

            " [\"I have a 6-year old corded mower from Home depot's own brand. It still runs fine, but its all metal construction makes it too heavy for moving around on tight corner during mowing. So, I am interested in trying out the light-weight corded mower from B&D.;Assembling the mower body itself is pretty easy, but putting together the grass collector box is quite a task that requires some handyman skills. Frankly, I think it's a design flaw. You need to assemble 4 pieces of hard plastic shells together to form the grass collector box. The process involves lining up several tabs for snapping them into the matching slots. But the tabs are not aligned and the plastic shell is pretty stiff to adjust. So, some brute force effort is needed. In a nutshell, it's a painful process to put together the grass collection box.This B&D; corded mower is far more lighter as it uses a lot of plastic material. It has a built-in cord loop on the lower handle bar for storing extension cord. Not sure if I want to dedicate a 50-feet cord just for this mower though.I try this mower couple of times. Though it's very light and quite, I know something is not quite right. It took me a while to realize the balance of this mower is off. The plastic shell construction make's it very light on the front deck. The long metal handler, plus the grass collecting box have quite some weight. When I run this mower, I keep getting into the condition that the front deck rises up. So, I end up having to intentionally hold the handler bar a little upward to prevent that from happening. Things are getting worse when the grass collecting box is half full, as it adds more weights and it is even more easier for the front deck to tip upward.One more thing that I don' t like this corded mower: the handle height is not adjustable. For me, the handle bar is a bit too high. On top of that, I have to intentionally hold the handle bar upward to prevent the front deck from tipping upward. So, after the mowing, my hand feel tired.At the end, I still go back to use my 6-year old Home Depot brand corded mower. I won't recommend this B&D; corded mower.\"]\n",
            " [\"I'm writing this review from the perspective of a fairly sedentary woman (i.e. not strong). Overall, I really liked the Black & Decker Corded Mower with Edge Max. It's quiet, easy to push and mows neatly. I got this mower out of the box, assembled--and mowed my entire front yard--within an hour!When I first opened the box, I was horrified--it looked like nothing was put together. I slowly began to assemble the grass catcher, and voila, I was able to lift the (assembled) mower out of the box WITH ONE HAND! It's quite light. Once the grass catcher is assembled, the rest goes pretty fast.However, while assembling the mower, I was disgusted with Black & Decker for their low standards: pieces that should have snapped together relatively easily took so much strength because of misaligned parts. They're like the opposite of LEGOs--pieces do *not* fit like a glove. In face, I needed a butter knife to help me push pieces together--more than once. I had to do both butt & chest presses on the grass catcher to have a couple of pieces finally snap into place. Thank goodness I did this in the privacy of my living room. I was sweating because of so much physical exertion (not the worst thing, mind you) to get that grass catcher put together correctly. Seriously, B&D;: Try Harder!Keep in mind: this does not come with a extension cord, so if you want to mow immediately, make sure you have a long one ready.The mower is so easy to push and control. I have used both gas power mowers and push mowers. This electric mower was the most pleasant mowing experience for me by far. The power one is hard for me to keep up with, and weights about as much as me. The push mower I used, a Fiskars mowers, was entirely abysmal: very hard to push and left your lawn looking like a terrible haircut.The one caveat I have is this: cords are a pain! Not just on this mower, but on all corded mowers. If I had the means, I'd totally buy an electric mower run on a battery. But for this low price, if you have the patience for a cord, this is a total deal. Drape the cord over your shoulder and not around your neck. Live and learn.\"]\n",

No pull! The cut is very clean and even and you should see it to understand how even it really is. Much better than my gas mower.I didn't use the grass catcher because I'd be dumping all the time. I didn't get grass on me anyway. The mulch dropped right down and didn't spray up.

My older Black and Decker electric had the battery built in and you had to plug it in to charge.This mower worked really great and was plenty powerful.  I do not let my grass grow too long and cut it at a min height of 3 inches.  The weight of this mower is not too bad, but a bit heavier than my gas one.  It is meant for smaller lawns, up to 1/8 of an acre and if your lawn is larger than that, you are better off with gas unless you want to wait around for the battery to charge.I have nothing bad to say about this mower and plan on using it all season, alternating between my gas and this.

            " [\"Set up was easy and took about 15 minutes from unboxing, full assembly, and batteries on the charger. Build quality is decent, mostly very heavy duty plastics with some metal like the handle. The batteries chaged quickly and in about an hour I was out mowing. (It came with two batteries and I already had a charger so the process for me was faster then if I would have had just the one charger).I have the 36v weed whacker and also the 36v blower. My weed trimmer is going on summer number 3. That battery is what I used as my back up just to test if the older 36v would work (the manual says they will). That battery has spent two Minnesota winters in an unheated shed, so I figured it would give me a good idea of how long the batteries are lasting. To the naked eye the 36v and 40v batteries are indistiguishable.Cutting power was very good. My yard is a mix of grass, dandelions, and other assorted weeds. The mower went through everything without issue. It is very quite, almost like a fan running on a super high setting. Mower is light weight and easy to push. It says to use it with the enclosed grass catcher only, so I did but next time out I am going to try it without and hope it can mulch.My yard is about 150x50 so about 7,500 square feet. I figure I am mowing about 4500-5000 square feet of it once the house,shed, garage, and driveway are subtracted. It took 3 batteries to get it done. The newer 40v ones seemed to have more juice than my old 36v. I got two full bags out of the 40v and 1.5 bags out of the 36v. I actually thought the 36v did quite well and feel good about these batteries lasting for several years.  When the batteries die, they die and there is no loss of power over time. You pretty much go from full power mower to nothing instantly. Issue is that if you have a lawn needing 3 batteries and you just have the two, you will need to schedule in some downtime as the batteries get warm as they are used and the charger will tell you via red light flashes that they are to hot to charge. I swapped out my 40 for the 36, finished off the 36 and my 40 was still to warm to charge.Overall I really like his mower. It does have some battery limits on it if your yard is big enough you can't finish with the two supplied. (I have 4 batteries now so for me not a big deal), but it does very well considering it is basically runnning on a weed whip battery. It is light, quiet, no gas fumes, and leaves a nice even cut in your wake. Cutting width is pretty good as well. I am very happy with it.

Otherwise you could be left with just have the amount of power that you need.']\n",
            " [\"I have some rental properties. When a property is vacant, I take careof the lawn. I have a corded mower, but I am tired of maintaining the cord.One time, I accidentally cut the cord while mowing. I have been thinking of getting a cordless mower, but that model has a heavy non-removable battery and the whole mower is way too heavy from transportation point of view.I am so happy to get this cordless mower with removable battery. I already have following 36-V cordless tools from B&D;: cordless line trimmer, cordless blower, and cordless hedge trimmer. To my surprise, this cordless mower from B&H; can take either 40V or 36V batteries. So, I have totally 5 batteries available for running this cordless mower.Majority of the construction material of this mower is thick plastic. With that, I would say the whole mower is a little on the flimsy side. However, that's good to me, as the mower is very light, not only from operation point of view, but also from transportation point of view. Even better yet, the whole handle bar can be easily collapsed down to take minimum space for both storage and transportation in my car.This mower is very quite, just like a fan running on high settings. The rear grass collecting bag is small but it is easy to remove and put back on. The light weight of this mower makes it easy to move around at tight corners.Some points need to be aware before choosing this cordless mower.One: each battery lasts about 15 minutes.Two: when a battery is fully drained, it usually is too hot to be charged. The charger will notify you on this and it won't start charging till the battery (inside) has cooled down. And each battery takes about one hour to be fully recharged. So, be expecting about 90-minute time for a fully drained battery to be available again.Three: It has limited power. When the grass is either too tall, or too dense, the motor will slow down. When the amount of grass is beyond its capability, the motor simply stops. Then, you have to release the button, wait for a minute and then re-start again. On the good side, it means there is no way you can burn the motor. On the negative side, it slows down your mowing work.All in all, as long as you are aware about the limitations of this cordless mower, I think it is a very good choice for properties with small lawns. I would definite recommend it to my friends.\"]\n",
            " ['**** See update below for why I knocked it down to 2 stars.  Original review is here: ****I bought my first electric lawn mower when I bought my first house in 2004. It was a Black and Decker MM675 with a flip-over handle. That lawn mower served me well for about 5 years and never let me down. Then, one day I used it when my lawn was too wet and the motor started to smoke as it bogged down on wet grass! I could no longer get the MM675 model, so I went to Home Depot and \"upgraded\" to the MM1800, the 18\" corded mulching/bagging mower from Black and Decker. Immediately I was dissatisfied. It didn\\'t feel as strong as my old mower, was more unwieldy, and had this awful plastic shroud that made it hard to maneuver. Everything on it felt cheap, and two years later, it died on me while mowing grass that was not that thick (the motor blew out and smoked).  I replaced it with aGreenWorks 25022 12 Amp 20-in 3-in-1 Electric Lawn Mowerand never looked back - that was a great corded mower and I used it until I found this new B&D; Mower.For mowing my own lawn, I did not consider gas because I don\\'t have the room to keep fuel around and I have a modest size yard. I have always relied on corded mowers because I felt the battery operated ones would be too weak and I didn\\'t want to deal with battery management.  Cords are a fine option, but sometimes you do want the freedom of a battery.All of that being said, B&D; really did a nice job with this battery operated mower, and for the first time in my adult mowing life, I think I might be back to both B&D; (and using battery operation).Opening the box, I found the mower in 3 pieces.  The battery was pre-installed (with half-charge), so all I had to do to assemble the mower was attached the handle.  The handle attaches in 2 parts.  You need to unscrew the 2 bolts on each side and screw them back in, but once installed, they loosen with a simple lever.  This allows you to collapse the handle easily for storage.  I have had \"easy fold\" handles before, but this one is actually easy.  The mower is very light, and with a handle on top of the body of the mower, I was easily able to lift it up and put it away in my crawl space.  I could do that with a gas or my previous corded mower.The mower includes two 40V B&D; LBXR2036 Lithium Batteries.  It says it is compatible with the lower voltage 36V LBXR36 batteries, but gives no indication of the performance difference.  This could be important because the 36V batteries are $80 and the 40V are $110.  So understand that you are getting over $200 worth of batteries with this mower and that is likely where much of the cost lies.  The batteries are the new Lithium Ion batteries which should hopefully not hold memory like the old NiCad.  You also get a really nice charger which has \"smarts\" to let you know when a battery is charged.  Each battery also has a \"power gauge\" to let you know how much power is left.Enough about the batteries - how does it mow?  I went outside shortly after it rained for the first mow of the season.  Yes - I was challenging the mower on all fronts.  I plugged in the safety key (great feature to keep your mower off when you aren\\'t around - it appears to be \"smart\" and won\\'t let you just short out the terminals).  I also decided not to bag initially.  The deck height setting is very easy - a single lever adjusts the deck.  I tried on setting 2 and made it surprisingly far until I bogged down the mower (no surprise - the grass was tall and wet).  Most impressively, the mower stopped on tall grass and didn\\'t burn out like my older corded mowers did.  It appears to know not to destroy itself.  You have to actually turn it off and then back on to get going, a nice feature to prevent you from overstressing the motor.  I set it higher (to 6) and mowed just fine.In terms of performance, I was able to mow my backyard with 1 battery and my front yard with the other.  Each worked for about 20 minutes (not quite the 30 advertised).  The mower cuts off quickly when the battery is dead, so no period of \"weak mowing\" when you\\'re not sure if you should replace it.  When it\\'s dead, it\\'s dead.The bag is very easy to attach and you don\\'t need to fight to keep it open like other bags.  It can\\'t hold much, so you\\'ll be emptying it a lot on heavy grass.A few other notes - the mower is very easy to turn and navigate thanks to the wide tires and oversized rear tires.  Unfortunately they are plastic (not rubber or real tires), but they seem to get the job done.  The mower is a total of about 17\" wide, so it will fit into very tight space, but it also means you might need to make more passes on your lawn than a wider mower.Overall, I was able to mow easily and certainly appreciated not having to handle cord management.  If you have a yard that can be mowed fully in 40 minutes and you don\\'t want to mess with power cords, this mower is certainly a fine choice.  All of that being said, be aware that you can get a high quality corded mower (like the Greenworks 25022) for a little more than the cost of 1 battery for this mower.  It makes the decision an economic and personal one - is it worth twice the cost to you to get a mower that is lighter and does not require a cord?  If the answer is \"yes\", then you will be quite happy with this B&D; Mower.**** UPDATE 5/15/2014 ****Sadly I had to knock it down to two stars today.  While mowing, I hit a few rocks which is common around here (very rocky soil).  My old Greenworks mower has a few small dings on the blade from hitting rocks, but it\\'s been going strong for years with the dings.  However, the small ding knocked the B&D; CM1640 totally out of balance.  It started vibrating and shaking while I mowed.  I hit a few more small rocks and it got worse.  These weren\\'t giant rocks mind you, but small ones that I have accidentally mowed with countless other mowers.  As I pushed on, the mower caught a root and it was all over.  The blade literally bent 90 degrees (see photo I uploaded).  It is now trash.  Maybe you will tell me I should be more careful about rocks, and maybe you will tell me I should be more careful about roots?  Both are possible, but all I can say is that I abuse my Greenworks mower and every season it starts right up.  I have hit quartz, granite, and just about everything else in my yard, and it is still humming.So why do I think this happened?  I have a theory - it\\'s a battery operated motor meaning they need to optimize everything to draw the lowest amount of current possible.  Looking at the blade, it appears they have made it thinner and lighter than a typical blade so it spins fast without drawing as much current.  The downside is what I just discovered - a fragile mower that breaks easily.One other thing I discovered - the batteries cannot be recharged immediately because they tend to get too hot.  The charger won\\'t charge them.  So you can\\'t recharge battery 1 while you mow with battery 2.  Another issue!I am going back to myGreenWorks 25022 12 Amp 20-in 3-in-1 Electric Lawn Mowerwhere you can read my review of that fine mower.  Once again I left it outside, under my deck, all winter, and it finished up my yard for me today great.  A few minutes with it reminded me why I left B&D; in the first place.']\n",
            " [\"First off, Amazon shipped this semi big box and arrived undamaged, good job. The B&D CM1640 Cordless mower is for that electronic vehicle lover in ya. Sure your using home energy to charge the batteries, but you aren't using gas anymore, and thats pretty cool. If you have a small lawn and don't let the grass grow to high, then this is the right mower for you. Yes, you have to get out there every week or so to keep the lawn from getting to high, but its worth it in the end. I have a small beach house with just a small front lawn, and this is perfect for it. Assembly was straightforward, just stick to the script in the manual. The grass catcher must be attached which I knocked a star off of it for, so no cutting grass without it. It comes with two batteries and they last about 15-30 minutes each. It is very easy to start, and like I mentioned before, envirofriendly! Overall, I highly recommend this mower for those with a green conscious or those with small lawns.\"]\n",
            " [\"I purchased this unit for my small FL farm.  Recently I fired what will probably be the last of the gardeners I ever hire (welcome to SoFL and lazy lawncare help).  I own a John Deere tractor which takes care of 90% of my mowing needs about the property.  However, the other 10% is landscaped and pathwayed and very difficult to maintain (especially in summer) with a string trimmer (my tractor would demolish these areas).  This little mower has a small diameter blade and is perfect for mowing on either side of pathway pavers and small grassy patches.  The mower was pretty much assembled in the box - all you have to do is attach the grass catcher, bolt on the arms, and charge the batteries.  Easy!  The only reason I didn't give the mower 5 stars was due to battery life.  I fully charged both batteries prior to use.  The first battery died after about 200 sq ft of usage and the 2d battery died after about 300 ft of usage.  I am currently recharging both batteries and will update this review if battery life improves.  Nonetheless, the area I needed to clean up is done for another week and took me little time to whip into shape with this machine.  I will probably buy one more battery and another charger should battery life not improve on this 2d charging round.\"]\n",
            " [\"I love having a battery-operated, cordless mower.  There's no gas smell and I know I'm being friendlier to the environment.  The mower works great - I didn't have any of the battery issues that others have noted.  We are easily able to mow our yard in approximately 40 minutes without a problem with the batteries.  The only downside that I can see to this mower is that you can't cut the lawn any higher than 3 inches, which is fine in the spring, but tough in the heat of summer when the lawn needs to be cut higher.\"]\n",
            " [\"First of all, understand that I think I'm the perfect person for this mower. Our front and back lawns are small. We are in a very suburban area so we have no field of weeds to deal with and our grass is the thin bladed stuff. If you had a big lawn and had to deal with a lot of weeds I'm not so sure this more would be so smart for you. You have to understand that battery-powered mowers are not nearly as powerful as corded electric or gas mowers. If you understand that and don't need that power than a mower like this is perfect. I love that it's much quieter and I'm never having to worry about gas or that darned cord getting in the way (I've had both). This thing is light! It's so easy to push that it makes me wonder how durable this is going to be in the long run. It almost feels like you're pushing a toy. The battery does not last as long as I was expecting. I have two small lawns (font and back) and I am able to get two sessions out of one battery. I would have expected three or four. If you were using this in the weeds you would have a struggle as the power you'd need just wouldn't be there. It has some good safety measure built into it like a key and a startup procedure that a small kid would struggle with. I have serious doubts about how long the rear collection basket is going to last as it seems like it's designed to fail sooner than later. The collection is super-cheap feeling and I have a feeling that no matter how careful I am with it I'll be buying an overpriced replacement in less than two years. I think that a part that is going to go on and off constantly deserves much more attention and reinforcement than this cheap bag. So keep that in mind before you buy it because I guarantee you that it will not last longer than a couple years.\"]\n",
            " [\"This is less noisy than the old electric mower. The people inside the house thought it was the next door neighbors mowing instead of right outside on their own lawn. The little pull bar is comfortable to hold against the handle and doesn't leave one with blisters.The mower did strain quite a bit when working through a weedy wild mustard patch. The power significantly dropped and the battery/mower have never seemed to recover fully. When working through a harder patch, the battery life does shorten considerably as more power is used up in a short amount of time. Before I used it on the mustard patch, I did the front lawn with plain grass. I made it through nearly the entire lawn on one battery only. Since the mustard patch, it takes a full charge on both of the batteries to make it through the front lawn and the battery power level seems to go up and down (can notice difference in the sound level). I'm slightly disappointed with the decline but the length of time the battery lasts has seemed to hold steady since, and the battery charges quickly in a couple hours so it's not difficult to prepare the batteries in time before a mowing day. A single battery will now last about 10-15 minutes.This is not a mulching mower, and I wouldn't really recommend using it &#34;unofficially&#34; as a mulching mower by leaving the bag off. The flap in the back is not light enough for the force of the moving air to blow the flap around to let the grass be expelled out the back. Instead, when I've tried, the grass gets matted underneath the blade. You have to have the bag on to hold the back flap up. It fills up pretty quickly, but there's a nifty tell-tale smaller flap that moves around at the top of the bag from the air movement. If it stops moving around, it's full of grass so the air can't reach the flap to move it around and it's time to empty it.Overall, the mower is easy to use and it's a blessing not to have to deal with gas or cords. It's light enough I can move it around back and forth like a vacuum cleaner (not the best mowing method, I know). As long as the battery doesn't decline further, I'm happy with it.\"]\n",
            " ['This Black & Decker LST420 trimmer / edger is part of the 20V Max tool system that uses the same line of rechargeable 20 volt batteries. It is a nice cordless trimmer with 2 power settings. The trimmer can be rotated so that it performs as an edger (which allows the orange wheel at the bottom of the trimmer to be rolled along a flat surface). As an edger it seemed to be adequate, although I admit that I rarely do edging. It was really good not having to drag an extension cord all over the yard. The trimmer speed can be set at 1 (for longer battery usage) or 2 (for more power).  The \"2\" setting feels closer to my 110 volt corded weedeater, although I found that the \"1\" setting was adequate for most of the weed-eating that I was doing. The first time I used the trimmer I got about 23 minutes on one fully charged battery using the \"1\" setting about 95 percent of the time.  (My second battery was charging). About 8 or 10 minutes of that time was cutting some grass and weeds about a foot tall. It didn\\'t get bogged down even on the \"1\" setting, which is good.  The box states in large letters, \"1 HOUR RUNTIME\" so I gave it 4 stars since I didn\\'t believe the other battery would give me about 37 minutes.  Next time if I can get about an hour on both batteries I\\'ll raise my rating to 5 stars.Assembly: Assembly was real easy and consisted of pushing the plastic guard into a slot (1 screw) and attaching the D shaped handle (1 bolt).Adjustments: The D shaped handle can be moved up and down the shaft, but the angle cannot be adjusted. The telescopic shaft can be shortened or lengthened. The distance between the center of the motor at the bottom of the shaft (center of the Black & Decker label on the motor) to the top of the handle can be adjusted from 36 inches to 49 inches. I\\'m 6 foot tall and it feels best fully extended for me.Batteries and cutting line: Two 20 volt LBXR2020 Type 4 40 Wh batteries are included. The manual indicates that it takes five hours to fully charge one battery. The following LI-ION batteries can also be used: LBX20, LBXR20, LB2X4020.  Use only 0.065 inch (1.65 mm) diameter round nylon monofilament line.  B&D; recommends the AF-100 spool:Black & Decker AF-100 String Trimmer Replacement Spool with 30 Feet of .065-Inch Line.Warranty: 2 years for home use.The LST420 works so good that my corded weedeater may just hang on the garage wall all summer long.']\n",

I don't have a lot of areas in which my grass has an opportunity to avoid my mower... but near my deck the common growth edge.  Normally I'd be concerned about gouging the wood of my cedar skirting, but the wheel that is really designed for edging,  makes a great depth guide to prevent wood gouging...

They\\'re easy on / easy off, lightweight, and relatively quick to charge.2.  Convenient, easy-to-use adjustments. This unit is quite versatile.  With a quick squeeze, the base rotates 180 degrees and snaps into place, thus making edging a breeze.  Another quick squeeze at the base and it\\'s back to being a \\'regular\\' trimmer.  The height adjustment is also an excellent feature.  Lift a little lever and the unit easily adjusts for different lengths. This enables my 11-yr old daughter to adjust the unit shorter so she can get a decent angle for trimming.  She had a tough time getting a good angle using my taller corded trimmer.3.  Very lightweight overall, yet balanced and sturdy.4.  Trimmer wheel.  I\\'ve seen a few disparaging reviews about the wheel, but frankly, I think it makes trimming easier and more uniform, too. First, it\\'s a godsend for helping my daughter make lawns look sharp in her new yard-care business (her previous work without such a guide was not pretty).  However, I love the wheel, too, as it makes edging a breeze.  I say if the wheel bothers you, be proactive and take it off!5.  I also like that the batteries work on other B & D products.  I have decided to get more B & D products that use these interchangable batteries, so there will be no more dealing with cords when I\\'m doing lawn care.  It will make things very convenient.What I don\\'t like:As mentioned, it\\'s not as powerful as my corded trimmer, but it still does the job and I\\'m quite happy with it.

Lithium also allows you to have it charged and ready without worrying about the juice draining.  I could not do that with the Ni-Cad and it always annoyed me when I wanted to trim the grass with the older 18v but the battery would be dead.It is extremely light with the battery attached, and feels very well made.  If you have a smaller lawn, this will work great for you.The batteries are only interchangeable with the 20v line.  I also have a Troy Bilt gas with dual strings, but that is heavy duty and it is not fair to compare gas to electricWhen I just need to quickly whack a few weeds, I love having the electric available because pull starting gas is no fun.  Electric also requires virtually no maintenance.I would highly recommend this.\"]\n",

The build quality has gone up quite a bit, and remember, my old one was going strong at seven years on the original batteries.  This one has far better balance and grips, and far more power than 2 additional watts would suggest.  Previously when switching into edger mode, I'd have to make 2-3 passes to cleanly edge my lawn.  This unit took one pass to do a job that looked as good as a corded edger.My lawn isn't that big so I haven't used the &#34;Runtime Extension&#34; feature.  The automatic feed spool works as well as my old model, so no stopping to feed out more trimmer string.  I also really like that it comes with two batteries.  One is all I need for the trimmer, but I usually get the blower and edger (I have all three in 18v) and I've found the leaf blowers can go through 2 batteries easily, so I can put this extra to good use.Overall I have to give it five stars.  Between my B&D; 18v trimmer, blower, and edger and my 36v cordless mower, I've never had any problems and all my batteries still work.  Whatever they are doing, they are doing it well.

As might be expected, it isn't quite as powerful as the 40 volt version but otherwise, is very similar in function, weight and appearance. I should also add, I've been putting the 40 volt to the paces and have been impressed by what it manages to handle. My first day out, I used it to trim everything between a bunch of fruit trees in a lot that was overgrown, thick and full of weeds. It cut grass, weeds and even underbrush like a pro. Amazing!So, as I mentioned, this is not quite as powerful but assuming you aren't using it to take down swamp growth but rather an average lawn, it is more than sufficient. The charge takes about an hour (max) and seems to last 30 to 45 minutes. The string does not require a bump which is nice and last through the entire trim without worry.Weight is not problematic although it is not skimpy like some electric versions. The battery is interchangeable with other B&D; products of the same voltage (a very nice touch). The entire machine is adjustable up/down to fit short or tall persons.

Dealing with the long and heavy extension cord while hot and tired was just too much.  I knew a gas trimmer would be way too heavy and bulky for me.Because my old trimmer was a black and decker, I was able to use the same string spools.  On one hand this was great, because I had 4 new spools.  On the other hand, I was hoping this trimmer would use thicker string.  I have chain link fence around the majority of my yard, and I would normally go through 3 spools of string each time I used the electric trimmer.  I assumed it would be the same with this Black and Decker LST420 trimmer.  Not the case.  I don't understand it.  Maybe it's because it rotates faster and is more efficient.  I don't know.  Whatever the reason, I am extremely happy about it.For my purposes, I am not a fan of the edging/wheel.  A lot of my sidewalk areas are higher than the yard level.  I found in these areas, the edger didn't work well.  On part of my driveway where they are the same level, it worked fine.  I also had trouble getting close to an area at the base of my porch, because the wheel seemed to hinder the reach of the string.I am very happy with this trimmer, and it is such a relief not to drag around that cumbersome mega-long extension cord (about 100' cord).\"]\n",

It charges faster and holds its charge longer between use. And it comes with two batteries! One to use and one to charge.  All rechargeable tools should come with two batteries!It also has a power slide that allows you to control how much power it is using. If you are just trimming grass, set it at 1 and the charge will last much longer. But if you have some big weeds, slide it up to 6 for more power.The trimmer line is automatic feed and you can buy replacement spools that just click on if you don't like winding your line.And I will admit the wheel on the front of the head does look silly, but it works. After you swivel the head around, you roll the wheel down the edge of your sidewalk and it becomes a very good edger, the wheel keeps it at a consistent depth.Overall a definite improvement over the old trimmer and I can't wait to get more of these 20v tools.\"]\n",

Edging works surprisingly well, with the reversible head and a wheel for maintaining constant height. The height of the wheel is just right so the string cuts into the dirt a little, making a neat edge-- nice enough that I no longer feel a need to pull out myB&D; LE750 Edge Hogfor anything other than edging around tree beds. The wheel also takes the unit\\'s weight during edging, reducing strain on my arms.Heavy, fibrous vine-like weeds are hard for this unit, the longer pieces end up not being cut all the way through, and wrap around the spinning part of the edger (which causes it to stop). If you\\'re bush-whacking, you\\'ll need a heavier-duty unit.But my only real complaint is hand-fatigue. I wish B&D; would come up with an easier safety mechanism than a trigger that has to be held constantly (at least a lower-tension trigger). My trigger-hand gets pretty tired after using the trimmer for a while, although the unit is not hand-specific (so I end up switching hands periodically). A minor complaint is the wheel makes it hard to get the trimmer right up to a wall.Two years ago, I had opted for the Ni-Cad poweredBlack & Decker NST2118because the B&D; Li-ion trimmer at the time was half-again as expensive. The lithium-powered models have since come down in price. Comparing this LST420 to the older NST2118, the LST420:* Has a more powerful 20V Li-ion battery (vs NST2118\\'s 18V Ni-Cad)* Li-ion battery weighs much less, 13oz vs NST2118\\'s 31oz* One Li-ion battery does my whole yard w/ power left over (the 2 NiCads struggled to do the same yard)* The edger wheel works much better than the NST2118\\'s extending edger \"bracket\" (which dragged on rough surfaces, and collapsed back into the unit when pressed against the ground)* The handle slides up and down the shaft to adjust (rather than tilting from a fixed location)* Quieter than the NST2118 (especially in low-power mode)I was an early adopter of rechargeable lawn equipment; this LST420 replaced my Ni-Cad NST2118, which had replaced my ancient CST2000 (circa mid-late 90s with 12V Lead-Acid battery). For household use, rechargeable lawn equipment is a definite win: low-maintenance, much quieter than gas, no emissions, no handling toxic fluids, and a lighter environmental footprint when the batteries are maintained and recycled properly.Seriously, this thing is nearly silent compared to commercial gas-powered units. Also note the battery warnings; it can take up to 10 hours to charge up a completely discharged battery, and B&D; advises not storing the battery discharged (eg, during winter).For household and other light duty, look no further than this great little trimmer. Those looking for heavier use might be better off with Black & Decker\\'s 36V or 40V versions. Commercial-duty users should stick to gas. For my use, this trimmer is perfect, and Highly Recommended.']\n",
            " [\"This was easy to set-up, easy to charge, and is lightly enough for me to carry around and get the job down. I had no trouble getting through some sizable weeds, trimming up the edges of my lawn, and guiding it along the fence. Even without instructions, which there are some very light instructions, the assembly was a piece of cake. The batteries work great, and don't make it that much heavier than my electrical one. I would take cordless over the hassle of the cord anyway. Really my only complaint is my electrical one came with two spools of wire, this only came with one. On the other hand, it did come with two batteries which is certainly a better bargain. And while I know some gas powered versions might have, well more power, no cords and no fumes are now high on my list of wants.This would be easy for anyone to use, and it worked well for me.\"]\n",

Just add the app to your phone, and it goes right with you.While we have used many variations of meat thermometers and alarms, this one is unique because in addition to having two probes which can be set separately, it also will connect with an app on your newer Bluetooth devices to monitor your food away from the kitchenI received a free sample to test for my review, so I put it through a few extra tests in order to write my review.I used boiling water to test the probe temperature along with my digital probe. Both probes on the thermometer measured within one degree of my own probe and one another.While these weren't slow by any means, they were slower in registering temperature than the digital probe that I use.After downloading the software, I was able to monitor the temperature in the living room on my iPhone.Overall, I was very impressed. I have chosen four stars (instead of five) because I found some of the instructions and documentation difficult to understand. Also, unless the app feature is important to you, I would recommend a standard thermometer just for the price.A nice device, and I appreciate being able to multitask.\"]\n",

This is my go-to thermometer.BBQ thermometer provided by CAPPEC.\"]\n",
            " ['If you browse through my reviewer profile you will see that I have reviewed many different BBQ accessories over the years.  I love gadgets and I love to grill.  I\\'ve used a number of different wireless thermometers and rarely grill without one anymore.This one is innovative compared to the others that I\\'ve used, because it uses a Bluetooth (BT) connection to connect to the CAPPEC app on my iPhone.  (Search for \"CAPPEC\" in the iTunes store.)  Since the iPhone has way more capabilities than a simple LED readout on a monitor, there are a lot more features available through the app.  Awesome!  For example, if you\\'re a data junkie like me, you\\'ll love the ability to watch a graph of the temps of your meat.So what do you get with this thermometer?*  A small black box that kind of reminds me of an AppleTV unit, only smaller.*  Two meat probes.*  A little screwdriver that you\\'ll need to get access to the batterycover.  (I wish I had found this before I struggled to get intothe battery hatch.  It\\'s a lot easier with this little jeweler\\'sscrewdriver.)Download the app from the app store (iTunes or Android...ooh, I wonder if I can side-load this onto my Kindle Fire tablet?) and launch the app.  Don\\'t do like I did and try to pair the receiver in the BT settings, because that\\'s now how this device works.  Just make sure BT is turned on on your phone.  The app recognized my receiver right away.Here\\'s a quick note about Bluetooth technology.  I don\\'t recall the precise limits of the BT standards, but in my experience most BT devices have a range of less than 25\\'.  This one had a comparable range where the signal was good up to about 20\\'-25\\'.  That\\'s fine with me, but it means I need to leave my iPhone outside near the grill.  Otherwise I\\'ll have to reacquire the signal when I go back outside.  This is important to understand though:  This thermometer is wireless, but it\\'s not what I\\'d call \"remote\".  Although you\\'re not exactly tethered to the probes, you can\\'t go inside to powder your nose and expect to keep the signal going.Now about the app...I work for a major entertainment company and a big part of our business is mobile apps.  Because of my job I\\'m probably a tougher critic of mobile apps than most people.  And although I have a couple of small gripes with this app, overall I\\'m very very happy with it.  And the genius of creating an app to connect to this thermometer is that the manufacturer can release enhancements and bug fixes in the future.  That\\'s fantastic, because I\\'ve used some remote thermometers that were pretty good but had flaws that could never be fixed.  I\\'m happy to know that this one will be upgraded over time.So the device itself is pretty rugged and durable.  The probes are very substantial and I expect them to last a long time.  Frankly I doubt I\\'ll use both probes simultaneously very often, just because I typically only cook one type of meat at a time.  On the other hand, I\\'ve been burned before (bad pun) by inaccurate sampling when I put the probe in the wrong spot.  It\\'s nice to have two probes and be able to poke the meat in more than one location.Overall I\\'m very happy with this thermometer.  It\\'s actually strong competition for my previous favorite.  The only reason I can think of to use my former favorite thermometer is if I need to leave the area and need a remote unit.  But I actually prefer to hang out by the grill, so that\\'s probably not going to be an issue.Well done, CAPPEC.I was provided this item for review.']\n",
            " [\"I am giving this product 4 1/2 stars instead of 5, and this is why.It lost the signal. My smoker is right outside my kitchen window, and within feet of my back door. The signal went no further than my very small kitchen. When trying it outdoors the signal was lost at the end of a thirty foot walkway, but our garage may have blocked the signal.Now beyond that, it was easy to install the three AAA batteries with the help of the little screwdriver provided. It was also a snap to download the free application. The App itself is a blast, full of extras beyond just keeping you informed of the temperature. The App also keeps a journal of your last 10 BBQs, keeps a temperature graph of what you are cooking, and has a separate page that keeps track of internal temperature and estimated cook time, although I thought it was showing a very short cook time for me, it actually wasn't all that far off in accuracy. However since I  go by temperature I didn't really  pay close attention to that feature. It accommodates 2 probes for those times when you have more meat to BBQ. I like that it comes preprogrammed with many different varieties of meats and the suggested temperatures for cooking them , both gourmet and USDA. If you want, you are able to customize your temperature setting as well.It was pretty cool later on in the evening being able to go back on the App and check out how the smoking temperature progressed over the course of the day.Can't wait to try this on a big Turkey or roast beef, when it cools down enough to have the oven on for hours again. I am hoping that when using it entirely in the house that the Bluetooth will work correctly.\"]\n",
            " [\"This is the second 'remote' thermometer that I have evaluated as review samples in recent months and of the two this is significantly better in ease of use and function.What I love about this is the app that you practically need to get the most out of this device is intuitive and far easier to use. The other thermometer I tested had as many features, but was so complicated to use that I almost gave up.Another feature that all of these thermometers share is accuracy. The probes are heavy duty and even the display and control unit is built to withstand the elements.There a few things you need to know because the instruction sheet is scant at best. To be fair, the information is in the sheet, but for some reason is easy to overlook. First, the real instructions are in a tab in the downloadable app. Second, when you go into bluetooth discovery mode you can pair this device to your phone or tablet, but it will not connect. The app does that for you.One other thing that you need to know is this has the same limitations as any bluetooth device. If you wander more than ten meters or there are obstructions between you and the unit you can drop the signal. That is not a flaw in this thermometer - it's part of the bluetooth specification. I tested the unit for distance and mine actually held for about twelve meters, so there is a little wiggle-room built in.I tested this with both a Galaxy Note 3 phone and a Tab 3 10.1 tablet. Both worked perfectly.Other things I love about this include the ability to use set temperatures for either gourmet or USDA for various meats and doneness, or set your own. And the ease of cleaning the probes after each use.Overall I am thrilled with this set. I know that borders on hyperbole, but that is truly how I feel. If you barbeque or grill outside and own a smartphone I strongly recommend this thermometer set.\"]\n",
            " [\"I don't barbecue, but I do use the oven.  This barbecue thermometer is great for ovens.  I get two probes, which is wonderful.  I tried it last night with a pork roast and it was so nice not to have to keep poking my meat with a thermometer.  Just set it and forget about it.The thermometer set up easily with the Android app on my HTC One.  I like being able to choose which cut of meat I'm using and having the app choose the temperate for me.  We can pick between gourmet temps or USDA recommended temps.I can also use my own temp settings (140 to 399 F), and there are four timer settings for each probe.  What for?  Adding marinade or turning the meat.  So very useful.For the pork roast last night, the device sounded several minutes before my app got word of it, but that's all right.Some improvements I would like to see include a container or bag to keep all the equipment together.  Also, the probes can go in the oven, but the display must hang outside.  If there were a way to make the entire setup oven/heatproof, that would be great.This product was provided for review by Cappec.\"]\n",
            " [\"The grill arrived well packed, and with no damaged parts.  It is fairly heavy, so have UPS drop it near where you plan to assemble it.  It took about 30 minutes to assemble, and went together pretty easily.  I recommend using real tools for the assembly rather than what's included.  I like that it takes up much less space than my other full sized grill.  While that is nice, moving it over my gravel driveway is not.  The casters are small, and don't seem all that robust.Cooking with it has been excellent.  We grilled some chicken, and it cooks quickly and easily, provided you don't keep the cover off too long, it loses heat quickly.  The grill plates are easy to clean with a wire brush, I use one of those 3 sided Weber brushes, and love it.If the grill won't move far, or you have a paved driveway, or deck this is a great unit.  If you have to move it over gravel or grass, you may want something with bigger wheels.\"]\n",
            " [\"I have to give props to the designers at FUEGO, the element manages to be incredibly functional while maintaining a very small footprint. It is a breeze to move around and there is plenty of room on the outside cooking zone (the grill has two zones with differing heat characteristics). I grilled 8 burgers and 6 bratwurst simultaneously using both zones. Assembly was quick and painless (&#60; 30min) thanks to very well thought out packaging. It felt like opening an iPhone; there was nearly no wasted space and you only had to unpack parts as they were needed. My only qualm with the assembly was that the quick instructions didn't account for a couple of included parts. They were however referenced in the manual, although in the parts list one part was called the ignition stick but in the instructions it was referred to as the lighting stick (just kind of weird considering how much attention to detail everything else was given). One thing to note is that in order to get the grill to temperature you MUST have the cover on. Even with the cover on, cooking took a bit longer than I was used to. Overall this is a sexy, sturdy, functional grill.\"]\n",
            " [\"We really like the design of this grill. Its got a sleek and futurist design that not only gives it a cool and hip look but is a great space saver as well. We normally keep our grill in an enclosed screened-in porch and roll it out onto the patio when in use. This keeps the grill out of the weather and hopefully helps preserve the life of it. We've had one of those grills that you've probably seen at the local hardware store. The big double grill with gas on one side and charcoal on the other. We even got the extra smoker that is added on the end of that. That thing is huge and heavy to roll around. Enter the  Fuego Element Gas Grill! Oh what a difference! We didn't need that big ole' huge thing that we've been using. I wouldn't grill at times when I really wanted to just because I didn't want to mess with getting that behemoth out.The biggest feature that we like about the Fuego is of course, the design. It's upright so it takes up little space. The grill tank even fits inside the stand. It takes less space up that way and it just looks better. Its design makes it easy and lightweight for us to roll out of the screened-in porch and onto the patio.The grill itself has a double ring of gas so that you can cook with both on or just one. I like that feature so you can get the grill super hot for steaks and burgers or cook in a more indirect heat for items that need to be on the grill longer.This grill is more like a kettle grill in that the lid comes completely off. The handles are made where you can hang the lid onto the handles when the lid is not on the grill. With this design, you don't have a warming rack. We actually like that because we usually take the warming racks off. The racks are just in our way and eventually get rust onto our food below if we don't remove them. Just keep that mind if you are use to using a warming rack or really like a hinged lid. We had a kettle grill moons ago and I actually always quite liked it so these things are not an issue with me.The grill itself seems to be well built and I hope it lasts a quite awhile. We have only been getting a couple years out of the last couple grills that we've had even though we keep ours under a porch.\"]\n",
            " ['Having recently junked another brand of round grill that either flared up or flickered out too many times, I very much appreciate the design of the Fuego Element.  The ring-within-ring design lets the cook put roasts and whole chickens in the center of the grill, and using only the outside ring, create the indirect cooking available on grills that take up more space. For the hamburger and steak crowd, use both burners, turning down the flame level after the grill heats up.  The grill has plenty of area to cook a meal for a group of six people.The grill arrived in excellent condition, thanks to lots of cardboard and some ingenious packaging.  The dizzying array of parts to assemble made sense thanks to charts on the outside of the carton (partially obscured by UPS \"caution\" tape) and in the instruction booklet.  Took about 45 minutes to unpack and assemble.  VERY good looking.There are a couple of convenience features that are on a Weber grill that we purchased at Christmas as a gift.  One is a warming rack farther from the flame than the cooking area, and the other is a scale that weighs the propane tank to tell the owner approximately how much gas is left in the tank.  But for family meals and casual entertaining, this grill is terrific.']\n",
            " [\"This is the grill you will want to show off to your friend. It is so beautiful, it is not just a grill! You can understand as it was designed by an Apple guy. Sleek, smooth black steel, roll easily on 4 wheels and small foot print. You can probably recall that was what used to describe the Apple computer!The gas tank is hidden inside the stand. All operations are precise, everything fit together impressively well. It took a bit more than 5 minutes to get up to 450 deg F not like the description said, but it is no matter. I had to adjust the flame down because it got too hot. I can't believe I would say that about a gas grill. Its maximum temperatures' rival that of a charcoal grill. While I still keep my favorite charcoal Weber, I have been using this grill mostly since I got it. I need that hight temperature for steaks, and this grill delivered effortlessly.Cooking with this grill is a real joy. You will love it.\"]\n",
            " [\"I had the chance to try this grill out, and having bought a number of grills in the past trying to find the right one I took the opportunity to check this one out. Overall, if I were to give it a buy, try or don't buy my rating on this would be a try and here is why.The grill itself is not the cheap. It's approx $300 at the time of this review and for that same price you could hit your big box hardware store and get a number of grills with larger cooking area, heavier quality lid to retain heat and may even have it assembled. Now what you won't get is a really neat looking grill. I mean this thing is sleek. I love the look of the grill and the functionality of how they hide the propane tank under it with a door on a hinge instead of just an exposed back like most grills use.I like the fact that the handles on the side of this grill are designed for multi use, you can for instance hang your cooking utensils on them. You can use them to wheel the grill around or you can even slide the lid to the grill on either side into the handle to create a small wind screen.This is the first grill I have seen with a function like this.So if it looks great, and has nice looking features what is wrong with it?Overall the grill is made out of quality materials from what I can tell. The door that holds the propane take is decent thickness, the handles are firm and don't flex when pulled. But here's the 2 main problems I have.The grill comes with cheap, very cheap plastic wheels. They work ok but I found that just wheeling the grill around the garage the wheels started to scuff pretty bad. As soon as I ran over anything it actually caused small dents in the wheel. The quality of them is just horrendous, I think they should have splurged and given an upgrade to the wheels to make them stronger and more durable. Other grills I have owned have had stronger, harder plastic wheels.The other issue is the quality of the lid. The lid is a HUGE piece of any grill. It's what holds the heat in and if it's thick you can retain a lot more heat making your propane be more efficient. It also does NOT have any type of hinge on it. You pick the lid up and have to put it somewhere out of your way. The grill does feature lid slits in the handles but that really isn't that easy to use when you are quickly trying to get the lid off to flip your food. Yes it works, but on more than one occasion the lid actually fell out of the mount when I was trying to use it. Nothing like a hot lid falling near your feet. Then there is the lid quality. The lid on every grill I have owned has been thick, you can't flex or bend it. This grill however the lid feels extremely cheap. In fact mine was bent when I unboxed it, Not a problem because it was so thin I could actually easily bend it back into shape. This lid should be much higher quality, it should not bend at all. Plus if you look at most grills the handle to the lid is on the front and it rotates upwards for a reason, lots of heat could burn you. Weber grills feature a lid similar to this one where you lift straight up but the difference is they have air vents you can open and shut to control heat. On this grill there are slits cut into the lid so if you are cooking you really should be wearing gloves when putting the lid on or off of this grill (especially off) so that you don't burn yourself.It's a neat design and that is really what you are buying here. Yes it functions, but there are so many things I don't like about this grill. If they would improve the quality of the wheels I'd probably bump this up to 4 stars. If they had a better quality lid with vents you could open/close it would get 5 stars. But at this price point to me there are several other options you could go with.I will add, the grill does assemble easily, took me around 30 minutes. It does heat up quickly and it does function.\"]\n",
            " [\"We've had Weber grills for a lifetime it seems. So I'm used to the standard grill that comes from the big box stores. After assembling and using it for awhile, there are some great strengths and a couple of weaknesses.Assembly was pretty easy although it was a little difficult getting one of the base parts to line up. A little strong arming and it sat in place long enough for me to get the screws in. In the end, there were some chains that were supposed to have something to do with the ignition and another one for the lid but no only did I not have an extra screw to attach it (as was implied in the directions) but I still couldn't see a purpose in them. The directions were sadly lacking here.The appearance is really neat. I really like the accessibility of the tank using the hinged front door panel. This allows us to turn the gas off at the tank for every use. Our Weber has the tank in the back with a grill front that makes it almost impossible to reach the tank knob. The lid and the circular grill base do not line up completely. I'm assuming this is because they are a thinner metal and it is pretty easy to make a domed shape slightly off. But I can keep the lid on without any problems, it is just a little off in alignment. The actual grill is supposed to have a marking on it to show which side faces down but I searched and searched and found no marking so I went with instinct on placement.It is pretty easy to move around but the wheels are mediocre and I didn't realize until after I put them on that there are two that specifically belong on the back and I had them mixed up. And that was a mistake on my part, they were indicated in the directions once I went back and read it again. I guess I was just assuming that wheels were wheels and they all looked the same at first glance.I had no trouble with ignition although it helps if I blow slightly at the gas towards the ignition. There are two burners (you can use one or both). It heats up quickly according to the temperature gauge on the lid. Mine definitely got to well over 500 and I think was 600 one time.What I really liked was how evenly it cooked our meat. We've cooked London broil, pork tenderloin and hamburgers. All seem to be a little more moist and nicely cooked. You can get a char on the outside but even though it is really hot, it seems to do more of a bake to the inside. I really liked how our food turned out and it was enough of a difference to notice.So I like how it cooks. I like the large grease pan although there is nothing disposable about it, it needs to be wiped/washed out. It does collect rain water but so does my Weber, even with a cover on - not sure how though.I like the look of this and the ease of use. I'm sure I will need even more time to make this work even more to my benefit. I am by no means a grill expert so a little experimentation and maybe I can learn a few more tricks.\"]\n",
            " [\"Grill arrived well-boxed (it's very heavy!) and all parts were intact (box was heavy enough to keep heavy-handed UPS drivers from damaging the contents).Parts were clearly defined with clear instructions on assembly.Note: You must supply your own propane tank.There is no cover, but basic covers from home-improvement stores will do the trick.Grill fired up perfectly from day one--no adjustments needed.This grill heats up SO FAST, you'll be shocked.  The temperature gauge is very accurate, according to my external gauge I use to double-check. (5 minutes is the max time I saw to hit max temperatures for searing.)The meat is seared quickly and perfectly!  No unevenness, even with large cuts of meat.The meat is cooked to perfection--every cut we tried came out exactly as we'd hoped.  I swear, we were on the brink of &#34;trying&#34; to get it to do something &#34;wrong&#34;, but it never did...we tried cheap steaks, expensive steaks, roasts, chicken pieces, whole chickens, various fish, and veggies.  It is awesome!  We have a really nice patio grill (not naming names, but it's a huge stainless one from Costco) and we have not used it ONCE since this arrived, except for comparison purposes.  This one has beat it out as far as quality of cooking, speed of cooking, ease of use, and looks.  Sorry, (insert Costco's fancy BBQ name here).The ONE con I could find is that the pizza stone is so expensive. I REALLY wanted to try it, as one of the big things I have always dreamed of doing is to make outdoor pizzas...maybe sometime down the line, I can afford it...but for now, that review will have to wait.It's beautiful, easy to move, easy to store, and above all else--is accurate (the thermometer works!) and a quality cooking tool.\"]\n",
            " ['[n.b.: See the revised comments at the end of this review]First off, this is a really strikingly attractive grill; you can\\'t help but be impressed with the clean, modern, Euro-style look. It\\'s almost futuristic. Call it the iGrill. Under the skin, though, it has a few issues.Assembly: This is pretty straightforward. It\\'ll take about a half hour of your time, and a few extra items: A box or utility knife, a large Phillips screwdriver, a 16mm end wrench (although an adjustable or even a 11/16ths will do as well), and a single quality AA battery. The instructions state that no battery is included, but mine had three- a cheap Chinese AA cell- which went right into the recycling bin- and a pair of \"Kirkland\" brand batteries that followed it there. There is also a stamped steel 16/14mm wrench included, but trying to use it to attach the casters is an exercise in frustration. Use a thicker wrench. You\\'ll thank me.The first step is to unpack the parts, and the makers have thoughtfully printed the unpacking and assembly instructions on the outside of the box (although you\\'ll find a little booklet inside as well.) Slice the box along the dotted line with your box knife and lift off. You can now remove the individual boxes inside, which slide together like parts of a wooden puzzle. Very clever. The first actual assembly step is to attach the wheels, using the 16mm wrench. Next, the metal grill attached to the base with M5 screws, and the tank hanger attaches to the grill with supplied M6 screws. Simple. Attach the \"spine\", a piece of rectangular tubing that stiffens the assembly, insert the AA battery and the control valve knob, invert the whole assembly, and you\\'re almost done. The instructions warn you to DO NOT USE THE HANDLE TO LIFT THE ASSEMBLY which is kind of odd, as there aren\\'t a lot of ways to lift this other than the handles. And if you can\\'t use the handles for lifting, how it it that you can use them for moving the cart? I grabbed the unit by the base and the grill and slowly eased it over.The door snaps into place easily, and is held shut by a pair of magnetic latches. Nice. Slide the good sized \"residue tray\" (drip pan) in, and the flame diffuser drops on to the top of the grill- or rather, it should drop on to the top of the grill, but it turned out that the sheet metal that forms the the lower part of the flying saucer you see in the photo was bent. One side looks like it took a substantial impact, or perhaps was dropped on its side before being packed. If I\\'d purchased this rather than having received a review item I\\'d have called the company at that point and requested a replacement part. Instead, I got out a rubber mallet and a chunk of 2x4 and reshaped the bowl so I could finish the assembly and review.Having done a bit of body work the diffuser now fit into the bowl, and that left only the task of placing the grill on top of the diffuser, rolling it across my driveway a safe distance from my house, and installing an LP gas tank.  I got some root vegetables form the house (carrot, onion, potato) for my first test and fired up the grill. It took only a minute to reach 200F, another minute and a half to reach 300F, and a total of five minutes to reach 400. 500 F took ten minutes, 550 took 15, and it never got any hotter than that.I tested both the single burner mode (outside ring) and the double burner mode, and looking at the flames from the vent slots under the burners, I noticed something odd: While the interior burner ring produced a series of perfect little lovely blue flames over the holes in the burner, indicating complete combustion, the outer ring produced an orange flame that was detached from the burner and moved around a lot. That suggested poor air flow, or possible too large a jet in that burner. I tried this with the lid on and off, and got the same results in both cases. There was a light wind, but I wouldn\\'t think that should be a problem with a well designed grill.  The poor combustion may be what my grill didn\\'t heat up as fast as the specs suggest it should; I may have to do some disassembly and checking to see if perhaps a jet is missing, or improperly installed. [Update: I tested it again on a wind-free day, and the flame was stable and blue. But the slightest breeze disrupts this.]Cooking burgers with both burners set on high, I was surprised to discover that there wasn\\'t as much heat coming out of the grill as I expected. I could hold my hand comfortable over the burner for several seconds with no discomfort. But if I placed the lid on, the temperature reached 500F quickly. It seems that the grill really needs to have the lid on for good efficiency.Another detail that concerned me had to do with the wheels- they\\'re plastic, and just rolling the grill over 15 feet of concrete resulted in scratches and dents. These are not the sort of caster wheels one should put on outdoor equipment. If you get one, I strongly suggest heading to your local home store and getting some hard rubber casters to replace them.So while this is an attractive, and generally well made grill, it does have a few issues that need to be addressed before i can really recommend it. Over the next few weeks I\\'m going to do some comparison cooking tests with my Weber Q 320, which has given me great service for the past several years. If I make any more discoveries I\\'ll update this review.Footnote: Fuego doesn\\'t appear to offer a cover for this grill to protect it from the elements, or at any rate, Amazon doesn\\'t offer a cover from Fuego.  You can buy some loose fitting covers from third-party suppliers, but I found a very inexpensive yet hard-wearing  all weather cover: A heavy-duty contractor  type garbage bag. Thanks to the cylindrical design a large garbage bag slips right over the grill. Mine stated on even through the 30mph+ wind thunderstorm we experienced a few days ago. Just remember to let the grill cool before you cover it!(Postscript: The maker, believing that my unit may have been damaged,  has offered to send me a replacement unit. When that one arrives I\\'ll evaluate it and update this review.)Followup: The replacement unit arrived two days ago and assembly went much faster this time, as I was familiar with the process. Unpacking it, though, I noticed that this one had a dent in the rim of the bowl, too (see photos). It wasn\\'t as bad as the first unit, and I could assemble it without bending it back into shape, so I left it alone for my tests. I also noticed that there was a big misalignment where the gas jet entered the outer burner tube (see photos), even more so than on the first unit. I finished the assembly, attached an LP gas tank, and began my tests, starting with time to temperature.As the grill heated up I noticed that the thermometer wasn\\'t moving- and then it abruptly jumped 25 or more degrees. Close inspection revealed that the needle on the temperature gauge was misaligned, and was rubbing against the face of the gauge. As this would make accurate measurements impossible, I turned off the grill and let it cool. I then swapped lids with grill #1, and started it up again. This time I got the following times:200 F - 45 sec300 F - 1:30400 F  - 2:50500 F - 5:00550 F - 5:45This was much faster than the times I obtained with the first grill. Heat seemed more even, too, even though the outer burner showed a lot of yellow.I like this grill a lot, for a number of reasons. The design is superb. Ease of use is first rate. Efficiency- also excellent. But I\\'m still concerned about the quality control. Mine had three problems that never should have gotten past quality control: The bent dish, the thermometer needle, and the misaligned burner tube. None interfere a lot with use, but they indicate a lack of attention to QC, and that suggests there may be other hidden problems. It may also be that I just happened to get two problem units from a bad production run. On the other hand, the company was very responsive about addressing the problems I reported. So my advice would be if you like the looks of this grill, go ahead and order it, but give it a very careful inspection when it arrives, and if there are problems, let Amazon and the maker know. They\\'ll take care of it.']\n",
            " [\"I have loved our Weber 426001 Q 300 Portable 393-Square-Inch 21700-BTU Liquid-Propane Gas Grill now for 4 years and without a hitch. But I have also become increasingly disabled so have been trying some more compact grills. I ordered this since like so many have stated, it LOOKS very APPLE like.Looks verses performance....Being so disabled I had 2 neighbors assemble it for me and as a reward, be the first to cook on it with MY food. The box is in itself like a little puzzle you follow to assemble the grill. It's really funny watching neighbors argue about assembly when drinking a few beers with such an odd cut along the dotted lines layout:-)It took maybe 30 minutes of actual assembly time using MY tools. Add another 15 minutes for USMC opinion sharing that wasn't needed but free entertainment for me anyway. On a side note, I wish Vendors would allow me to choose WHO delivers my parcels....Especially given what my driver has told me about the FUN they have seeing who can toss what the HARDEST off of walls etc......Given the ripped, torn, slashed parcels I have received from UPS I have NO respect for them and would elect to even pay a premium for FEDEX or USPS. Luckily, the contents here were &#8220;OK&#8221; and all worked fine.We had very quick and EVEN cooking/heat. We only elected to cook 6 hamburgers since Marines I know anyway are happy as can be with just good old beer & burgers. Meat was juicy as any other grill I have owned as long as I do NOT flip them constantly. I cook 4 minute on Medium, flip for another 3-4 minutes and EAT the suckers.I LOVE the look and functional design. I am still getting used to using the lid design but I am so disabled I have odd problems with even the most simple things. I like the locking wheels though I can't imagine my wheelchair going fast enough with a lap full food to add to the grill that I could really have much NEED for them?To be honest, it is simply the BEAUTY of this that attracts me to it so much. I give it 4 stars and if nothing fails or no weak links appear, I will raise it to 5 stars. I will also have to buy another LPG cylinder if I keep using this over my other since I am unable to swap out my single tank between my grills and this does NOT come with one of it's own....No big deal, just be aware you do NOT get one included.. The one negative for me and it is sort of a BIG one since I am so disabled is this has no fold up/down side trays of any type. This is one of those things where it is simply built to show off it's looks and for me anyway, a very much needed item is left out to help keep it beautiful. Still, I NEED that so have to use a patio table next to it for this purpose instead.\"]\n",
            " ['FUEGO FELG21C Element Gas Grill Carbon SteelThis grill is smaller in size but has some nice features.  Assembly was reasonably straight forward.  The included wrench like all included wrenches is worthless but it was a nice gesture.  Assembly was pretty straight forward.  The instructions were adequate, not great but not particularly bad.  Assembly was pretty straight forward.  The size is substantially smaller than my previous grills but then so is the number of folks for whom I grill.The size is appropriate for practically everything but a large party.  The quality seems very substantial and a very reasonable price.  The grill top is very solid and appears to be the one that needs seasoned.  They do not make it clear which one of the two grill tops they seem to have for the same grill. One needs seasoned and the other does not.  Size wise this would be a great grill for an apartment or small area.  There is no tray or table attached which is one of the reasons it is so diminutive.  The burner set up as a higher intensity burner in the center and lower on the outside.  The center burner seems to incorporate the outside burner while the outside burner seems to allow the inside burner to remain unused providing a more indirect and slower cooking.The electronic ignition does not work.  I tried three different batteries and it never generated a spark.  The instructions state to put the side of the grill down that is marked face down.  I found nothing anywhere that said \"face down\".  There was a bag of screws that were very similar in appearance and are not the same.  Two bags of clearly marked screws would be better.  Overall, ignoring the minor issues, it is a nice grill that seems like it should be reasonably durable.']\n",

As the continued description states, it comes with TWO detachable machine washable heads...1 head attached and 1 replacement head, 2 heads total as shown in the picture.Up until now I have been contending with nylon bristled, and silicon bristled basting brushes. While they have their good uses in the kitchen for small jobs, they fall far short with many jobs on the grill. You simply can not quickly apply large quantities of sauce/marinade with those types. Also, most have very short handles which forces your hands down too close to the heat and that takes away from the fun of grilling.This is the perfect grilling companion for quickly slopping your sauces onto your meats. It provides quick and easy coverage with a long and sturdy handle so you can get the job done fast and get back to your beer, your lady friend, or whatever. I can not recommend this basting mop enough for anyone who does a lot of BBQ such as racks of ribs. You can really slop a lot of sauce on quickly.The heads screw onto the handle securely so they will not be coming loose in the middle of the job. For cleanup, I removed the head and only hand-washed the handle. I hand-washed the head under running water with a bit of dish soap to get the majority of the sauce out and then I tossed it into the dishwasher along with my dishes to get it looking as clean as new again.

Having said this, I still think it is fantastic. I was worried about the clean up but was pleasantly surprised that the mop head cleaned extremely well and dried in a small amount of time.

It came out perfectly clean, without loosing the first string. (Flash back to many a bad string mop experience!)This mop does come with two heads that very easily screw on and off for replacement. That is great for various reasons, the main being the ability to baste meat and vegetables with a different brush. It  provides great coverage on the meat . We used it on ribs and it couldn't have performed better.  We then swapped the head to baste the zucchini with an olive oil herb mix. It was superb for both uses.

Short of tearing our home down, there is simply NO WAY to find all the cracks and crevices that these critters climb through, to gain entry into our home. When you go to grab your frying pan and there is both mouse turds and urine coating a pan you used a week ago; when you go to grab your coffee beans from a Tupperware container only to find a hole gnawed in the side and a mouse INSIDE the container, EATING the beans, it\\'s time to use these traps!Before buying these traps, 20 at a time, we tried bate, a standard wire mouse trap, heck!, we even have three cats!

Usually we have 10 traps set up at a time all over the kitchen/bathroom, which is the area of our farm house that has settled the most over the root cellar. I have the traps either taped down with blue \"painter\\'s tape\" so they can\\'t move all over the place, trying to get free. And out of the deepest respect for the poor mouse, once trapped, I cover it with a paper towel to cover the remainder of the glue board, place the mouse into a plastic bag, and then place the poor thing into a deep freeze we have in the garage. Within 15 minutes, I\\'ve euthanized it as kindly as I can, into a deep sleep. And then into the trash bin it goes.

            " ['I\\'ve used both a light Earthwise battery string trimmer and a Stihl gas trimmer.  I fully expected this unit to be tougher than the light battery trimmer, but I didn\\'t expect it to blow the gas trimmer away.  It did, in spades.  I live in the country and have pasture fence lines, banks and other troublesome areas to trim.  I love the little Earthwise trimmer for grass and light weeds around the barn, house and yard, but don\\'t expect it to do any hard stuff.  On the other hand it\\'s gotten to where I don\\'t want to use the gas trimmer anymore at all because it can\\'t handle the firmer stemmed things like poke weeds or briars along fence lines, which means I also have to go over most of those areas with the Stihl blade trimmer (which doesn\\'t cut the long grass).It\\'s gotten so starting the gas trimmers is hard for me and since I have to stop and rest regularly, I either have to restart them too often or they just run out of gas, so the trimming just wasn\\'t getting done in all the difficult places.  I was learning to live with the overgrowth.  I decided to give this thing a try and am really amazed.When I got the box, I was worried about how heavy it was (that battery weighs a good 5 lbs), but it turned out that the weight is well balanced and although heavier than the light Earthwise unit, is a lot easier to use than I anticipated.  It comes fully assembled except for putting on the helper handle which is easy and requires no tools.  You put it where it\\'s most comfortable for you.  The red string guard has to be put on as well, but fits in position easily and the screws are already started in place.  You just need a Phillips screwdriver to finish the job.  There is already string installed. There is a direction book, but I didn\\'t need it.  Everything is intuitive.  My first battery charge took two hours to reach full power.So out to give it a try.  I was not kind, pretty mean actually, running it through mixed combinations of weedy stuff from very thick new spring growth, to leftover stems from last year.  It was far more powerful than the gas trimmer and ripped through some pretty tough stuff.  The line is surprisingly strong and in my entire session I only had to bump it to extend the line four times.  Consider that I was using the trimmer up against fence posts, sapling stumps, trellis supports and all manner of other \\'hazards\\'.  While the trimmer couldn\\'t cut the woody stems of some things like young trees that had gotten hold in the last couple of years, it managed most things including young blackberry canes, young poke weeds and what was left of last year\\'s growth.  Sometimes it jammed briefly, but then started right back up again when freed from the troublesome area.  It even restarted fine after getting into some wire that wrapped around the head.  I got the wire off and it was good to go again.Regarding battery life.  I really tried to run it out, but it ran me out and was still going strong.  I cut a bank that is too steep for the tractor that is about 80\\' long and 2-3\\' wide.  It has folded over mounds of grass from years of not being cut plus new spring growth.  It\\'s really thick, but no match for this trimmer.  Then I trimmed about 100\\' of fence line that required passes on both sides.  I can\\'t get the tractor closer than about 18\" to 2\\' on one side and the growth along there includes everything from spring weeds and poke weeds to briars and would be trees, cedars and maples.  The trimmer did a creditable job of getting rid of most, if not all of it.  I did a few more projects and kept looking for others, but I finally gave up too tired to move.  I expect the trimmer had been on about 40 minutes although all together with my moving around and resting I\\'d been at for easily twice that long.  After reading the product description here, I see variable speed is possible, but I had it running full bore the whole time.  Guess I could read the book :). (note: I did read the book and found the most cool thing: there\\'s a button on the back of the battery I hadn\\'t noticed.  When you press it, it shows how much battery charge you have left.  I wish all batteries had that feature.)It certainly is nice to have the thing stop when you release the trigger and restart instantly when you\\'re ready to go again. When you\\'re ready for a recharge, you press the appropriate spot the battery pack ejects and is easy to remove.  I hadn\\'t run it completely out, but I must have been close and still it recharged fully in less than two hours.I can\\'t speak to changing the line since I haven\\'t had to do that yet and although I had the edging guide down part of the time to keep away from the fence posts as much as possible, didn\\'t try actual edging, so I can\\'t speak to that either.  My overall impression is that this trimmer is well worth the price.  It certainly isn\\'t cheap, but is powerful enough to do really hard work, is easy to operate and has a long battery life.  For me it will take the place of both my gas string trimmer and blade trimmer.  And it will actually get used!']\n",

Finally, the battery (I have the 4.0 Ah) lasts long enough for me to cut my very small yard and still not have to recharge for the next use.The battery is definitely heavier than those of my old trimmer.  It's worth it to me though because the machine I had been using for two years wasn't worth a darn.  Another difference is that the power output for this Oregon unit is constant.

            " [\"When moving into my house nearly ten years ago, I first started with a corded trimmer. Untangling and tripping over the cord was a massive irritation, not to mention having to attach several of them together to reach the farthest corners of my backyard.So I upgraded to theBlack & Decker LST220 12-Inch 20-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless GrassHog Trimmer/Edger. This was a major improvement and I was happy with it until I got my hands on the GreenWorks Cordless Lithium-Ion String Trimmer/Edger. The longer shaft and adjustable handle on the GreenWorks made all the difference. The sturdiness and longer battery life were nice too, but I found the balance was slightly off and the trimmer head was never quite at the ideal angle for my arm length (even though it was somewhat adjustable).Two years later, I was introduced to the OREGON Cordless ST275-A6. It was like upgrading from a Toyota to a Lexus. Both very good in their own right, but the OREGON is more refined.I say refined, but in a sense it's simpler. No pivoting head, auto line feed or guide wheels. But I found I didn't need them. The OREGON is balanced and positioned perfectly for my long arms. The bump feed makes for an extra step, but gives you control over how much line you use (plus a more simplified system means cheaper repairs if it breaks down). The dual line increases efficiency by providing a cleaner cut and is better for thick overgrown grass. And because there are two lines, it keeps the vibration level at a minimum, which is great for people using this professionally -- less nerve trauma at the end of a long day. The best part, for me, is the large grip handle. Surprisingly, this was a commonly flawed feature on all the trimmers I've previously tried. But the OREGON got it perfectly! Sturdy, comfortable grip, ideal height, and can be positioned on -- rotate and slide up or down -- the shaft exactly how I want it.If you cut lawns professionally, or just want a better experience in your own backyard, then I recommend giving this OREGON a try.\"]\n",
            " ['The Oregon MAX Trimmer/Edger  is my second foray into the world of battery-powered trimmers.  I bought a Core CGT400 trimmer last summer and I ended up returning it due to a faulty trim head.  The Core worked pretty well but didn\\'t have power to match a gas powered trimmer.  The Oregon MAX falls into the same category; it works well, but the thick St. Augustine grass in Texas does cause you to have to walk slowly and sometimes you have to go back over the same area twice.PROs-------------------+ light and well balanced+ battery lasts a long time and holds its charge when stored+ no cords and no smelly gas+ terrific edging guide featureCONs-------------------- underpowered compared to a gas trimmer- small cut area compared to other trimmers I\\'ve usedThe unit only has 4\" of exposed trim line (though it is double-sided from the trim head).  This is 2\" less than my Honda gas trimmer and 1\" less than the Core CGT400.  I assume the cutting area is reduced so that the motor doesn\\'t get bogged down due to insufficient of power.  The problem with this design compromise is that it slows you down because the cutting area isn\\'t as large as other trimmers.Fortunately, the slower trimming is tolerable because the Oregon MAX is lightweight and the battery lasts a really long time.  I trimmed/edged 800 linear feet of curb and fence of my corner lot and the power held steady the entire time.  The battery has an LED indicator that tells you how much charge remains.  After 800 feet of cutting, the 4Ah battery indicated that it was half charged.  Impressive!The Oregon MAX is well balanced and easy to maneuver.  Being quite light, and having a long reach, it doesn\\'t tire you out during long jobs.  The bump head works well and advances string readily without kinking.  It is a dual-line model which allows you to do more cutting for the same RPMs.The most outstanding feature of this trimmer is the edging guide.  A metal guide swings down and you simply pull the trigger to full RPMs and slide this guide along your curb and you will get the straightest, most perfect, edging I\\'ve ever seen from a hand-held trimmer.  It is amazing and it\\'s a feature I wish every trimmer had.  Even edging the thick St. Augustine grass worked pretty well.  The relatively thin line did break off a bit often, but I plan on installing thicker line in the future.The handle was very easy to adjust to a position that worked for either edging or trimming.  Once I got it \"just right\", I could go back and forth between trimming and edging without pause.One thing I noticed while edging is that the debris guard is not that helpful.  The edger threw up a cloud of dust and I was covered in dirt by the time I was done.The battery uses lithium ion technology and holds its charge between uses.  That is really handy as you can charge it and then let it sit without worrying that it will be dead the next time need it.The unit is very well built and seems like it will last a long time.If you live in a part of the country with \"normal\" grass, the Oregon MAX will have plenty of power to quickly handle big trimming and edging jobs.  With rugged St. Augustine \"grass\" (really a vine) in Texas, the Oregon MAX is a bit out-classed.  That said, if you want something light and cord-free, I definitely recommend the Oregon MAX.  And the edging feature is pretty darn cool.']\n",
            " ['I own this trimmer as well as a Black and Decker model with a 40-volt battery. This one has the edge over the B&D because it is better balanced and has a more durable trim line. The shaft on this Oregon trimmer is longer than that of the B&D trimmer and the battery assembly on the back balances the weight of the trimmer at the other end, which reduces fatigue. The trim line is a durable cable, which requires less fuss and replacement than the plastic line of the B&D trimmer. I find the power to comparable to a gas trimmer. I have used it to edge and trim not only grass but also perennials and tougher weeds and it has done the job well.']\n",

They worked, but the safe temp limit was about 200 degrees, which meant while I could pick up food with them, I could not use them as general heat protection mitts.These, however, are made of silicone and have a far higher temp resistance while still making it possible to use them to pick up food.

Anyone with extra large finger or wide hands many have trouble putting them on.  On the other hand if you have very small hands you&#8217;ll swim in them.

If you have large hands you may be in for a struggle.While it may take some effort to wear these gloves, the improved safety is worth it in my opinion.

It makes a perfect lamp to attach to you headboard and read by.  It is perfect to attach near your entrance door for those nights that you forgot to turn on the outside light and are fumbling with your keys and packages. It is better than walking though the dark with a flashlight since women can simply attach it to their purse handle (if it is thick enough) A simple tap turns this very bright; almost flood-light like lamp on.It is good if you need a concentrated beam of light when you are working on some household projects.  The head moves up and down, but does not swivel, but it can still help when you need both hands to handle tools and a flashlight won't cut it.Unfortunately for some of these uses the batteries don't last long enough.  Which is okay if you use rechargeable batteries and leave the battery cover off to make it easier to change them out.I experimented and found that I had gotten about 3 hours of non-stop light - this is perfect when used for its intended purpose - but not quite long enough for reading.

To open the battery compartment, you will need a small Phillips screwdriver.  Do not forget to put the ribbon under the batteries because the battery well is deep.  When it is time to replace the batteries, you just pull the ribbon and the batteries come out.The light can pivot in a wide range of angles both vertically and horizontally.  The on/off button is soft touch.  Just tap it lightly with your finger to operate.  This is a great feature as the location of the button is completely flat; you can just wipe it to clean.Limitation:This is good when you grill with the lid open because that is where you clamp the light on.  If you have to close the lid often then it is a hassle to keep removing and clamping back the light.  The solution is to have another place close to the grill to anchor the light on.Other uses:You can use the light wherever you have a pole or an edge where you can clamp the light on.  Great for camping, garage, or even as an emergency car flashlight.Suggestion: This can be made better if the screw thread is wider apart so you don't have to turn the knob too many times to clamp (or unclamp) the light.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.\"]\n",
            " [\"Whenever I grill I always make sure that the food is at the proper temperature. The best way to do that is to use a digital thermometer. This model this model is lightweight and comes with a plastic sheath with pen clip. The packaging says that the measuring range of this thermometer is -58F-572F.There are three buttons on the thermometer, a hold button, the on/off button and the degrees Celsius/degrees Fahrenheit button. You have to press down firmly on the on/off button to get the thermometer to turn on. My only dislike in this thermometer is that the buttons are very small and I found myself having to use a fingernail to get them to work as my finger was too large and sometimes I would hit the other buttons. This is why deducted one star. Within seconds you are ready to take the temperature of your favorite cut of meat.  I compared the readings with this thermometer to another digital thermometer I had and they were both within a tenth of a degree. The feature I like best about this thermometer is the hold button. Before withdrawing the thermometer from the food, when you press the hold button it will hold the temperature reading until it is pressed again. This prevents the thermometer's temperature to fall drastically when testing another part of the meat. It also has a nice battery saving feature as it will turn itself off after 45 minutes if no buttons are pressed. It also has a nice chart on the back of the packaging  to tell you what the proper temperature of each of your meats should be.Overall, this is a great value for the price.

It tested accurate within a degree for both ice water and boiling water and reads within a degree or two of other kitchen thermometers I own. It is also reasonably priced at under ten dollars. So, if you are buying this thermometer primarily for testing meat in the kitchen, it's going to do the job and do it reasonably well.However, it's a rather basic thermometer. Its display is fairly small and requires me to use my reading glasses. (I have two kitchen thermometers with a much larger display with 1/2 inch digits. These are extremely easy to read, even without my glasses.)The on-off, C/F, and Hold buttons are quite small and very close together. I found that working these buttons was a bit awkward and required a good deal of pressure to get them to work.Finally, the probe is just 5 inches long, which will be adequate for some purposes, but will be a bit short for getting into the center of large piece of meat, such as a whole turkey. Also, for testing the temperature of meat on an outdoor grill it's nice to have a longer probe so one can keep one's hand further away from the heat.Of course, you're going to pay more for a thermometer with a longer probe, a larger display, and more features. So, if you just want a basic thermometer that will do the job, this is the one to buy.Note: I received this product in exchange for writing an honest review.

Press the little C/F button to switch to Fahrenheit if  desired, then insert probe into thickest part of meat without touching bone , and read temperature. It is fairly quick to come up to temperature at first, but those last few tenths of a degree get a little slow, which is not a problem as for most of us a few tenths of a degree are negligible.If you want to remember that temperature, keep the probe in the meat and press the Hold button , it will hold that temperature in its memory until pressed again, unless you turn off the unit.

However, NSF certifies not just the measurement, but also that the design meets the standards for being able to clean (from my vantage, this Gogogu is just as cleanable as the Taylor.)

I will say that this is an accurate and reasonably priced instrument that does have a few minor issues. First, mine would not turn on when I pressed the on/off switch, so I opened the top casing to get to the battery. I pushed the battery firmly into the holder and the thermometer activated when I tried the switch the second time.The problem I had was not so much opening the case or activating the battery, but getting the top of the readout display back on the body of the unit. After much fumbling I saw that there is a guide hold in the bottom part of the case and a peg in the top. After aligning them (difficult because the case blocks the view when you start closing it), I was able to seat the top and start using the thermometer. For this I subtracted a star because the instructions printed on the back of the retain packaging did not mention it, and it's not obvious at first glance. It may be a clever design, but it's not a consumer friendly one.Despite that issue I do love the accuracy, the fact that it displays to one decimal place, and the tactile feedback from the small buttons. An added bonus for me is some recipes I use are based on Celsius and metric measurements. I have to convert them most of the time, but this thermometer defaults to C.

I loved them so much that I bought a second set so I\\'d have four of the skewers.First I have to confess that I haven\\'t used the mats yet.  I haven\\'t quite found the right use for them, plus I keep my grill pretty hot and these are only for use up to 500 degrees.  The skewers though, oh the skewers...I made a nice big set of kebabs for my family and quickly realized that I can\\'t recall the last time I made kebabs.  Why not?  Because I\\'ve always had such horrible luck with them.  I have such a hard time turning the kebabs without just having the chunks of stuff twirl around on the skewers.  So the food cooks unevenly and a lot of the pieces even fall off.  That\\'s no good at all.  But these skewers loop around on themselves to make a complete ring, which means that it\\'s very simple to turn them over:  just grab the pointy end with your tongs and gently turn the whole business over (use a spatula to support the other end if you\\'re worried about being too rough with them).These wire skewers are nice and long.

            " [\"Whoever designed this product obviously grills differently than how we do it in the US. These mats are not suitable for conventional outdoor grilling, where high heat and licks of flame are part of the process. These mats are suitable to use in place of parchment paper on your cookie sheets.I grill because I want to create nice crusty sear marks on my foods, whether it be steaks, burgers, kabobs, veggies, seafood or fish. Even when I need to cook foods at a lower-than-high temperature, I still start out by searing the outside. Why bother grilling if that is not the result you are looking for?When I grill over fire (wood or charcoal), even when I try to prevent flare-ups, they happen. And when I crank up the Weber gas grill, it heats to well-over 500 degrees before I toss on the food. Same with my Char Broil infrared grill.The mats are basically like a Silpat mat.Mats are NOT suitable for live fire grilling: Why? Because you can NOT allow flame to touch them.Mats are NOT suitable for searing: Why? Because you can NOT allow temperature to go over 500 degrees Fahrenheit.With these mats, you will definitely prevent your grill grates from getting messy, but you will never be able to create a Maillard Effect (caramelization), because you will never be able to get the mats hot enough to create a sear. And, if you've used a marinade, and if your food becomes juicy, the liquid will run off the mat because there is no lip....Hmmmm.....So you will still get flare-ups and you will still get your grates messy.ABOUT THE SKEWERS: They, also, are limited in use: The tips are rounded, not pointy and sharp for easy piercing. These rounded tips mangle delicate seafood and veggies. Forget trying to skewer tomatoes, onion rings, peppers or shrimp. Take a close look at the middle picture, you can see how rounded the tips are. Also, notice that the tips are a bigger diameter than the rest of the skewer. What that means is this: You thread the food over the tips and create a big hole. Then you slide it onto the very pliable thinner cable. Your food will definitely NOT hold in place. It swings around and flops around on the narrow cable, because it started out by going through a big hole.And I'm not sure how this replaces aluminum foil or how it can be used effectively for roasting: Foil wraps any way you want it to, and it can keep fluids contained so you don't lose the juices and so you don't dirty a pan. These mats are flat and will always be flat and fluid will run right off of it.All around this is a very bad idea for the grill.*I received a sample product from TeiKis for review, and I'm not a wimp and not afraid to hand out one-star reviews when they are warranted. If I had paid money for this crap, I would be livid right now.

I'm thinking they might be useful in the bottom of my oven when I bake items that could spill over.These are handy items but they do come with restrictions: store flat, they cannot be placed over flames, should not be heated above 500 F & don't use sharp utensils on the mat.The stainless steel skewers are flexible so you can arrange them around the food that's cooking on the grill.

Not only that the mat is easy to clean because it performs like Teflon that almost nothing sticks into it, but the biggest advantage is it prevents your grill from getting dirty.  As you know the soot, the grease, etc. are one of the toughest grime to clean.- As long as you keep grease from dripping below, there is no flare-up.Cons:- You cannot let fire (or exceeds 500 degrees F) from touching the mat- Searing is almost impossible to achieve because you have to make sure you don\\'t let the temperature exceed 500 degrees plus the fact that the mat practically converts the grill into an oversized frying pan.  The juices and the oil remains on the meat on the mat which makes it fried and not grilled.The skewer:It includes a pair of skewers.  The skewer might be the most durable skewer you will ever own (aside from a pure metal spits).  It is indestructible.  It is made of braided metal cable with solid metal tips.  The tip is rounded which makes it difficult to poke meat on it and makes big holes on veggies.  It is pretty long so you have to loop it or bend it around the grill surface to fit.  Also makes it hard to turn because the metal conducts heat.

Keeping in mind that I'm not a BBQ expert (and I've never tried to grill veggies before), the results were pretty good.The sheets are a thin Teflon-based (PTFE-coated) pad that you toss on the BBQ to heat/roast/cook whatever you have in mind. I used it for veggies I had marinated in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. You have to make sure the pad is not exposed to open flame, nor used in temps over 500 degrees. When I got done with the grilling (complete with sizzling marinade), the veggies were nicely singed and soft. It's a little hard to work with the sheet right off the grill, as there's no real structure or stiffness to it. I had to scoop most of the veggies off with a spatula before I could grab the corners and pour the rest of the marinade into the bowl. Washing was a little strange (hand-washing), as it was hard to scrub it down to make it feel completely clean. On the next pass, I'll probably run it through the dishwasher.The skewers were a bit more iffy for me. It was better for larger chunks, as the &#34;sharp end&#34; is more blunt than the typical wooden skewers. I liked how you can shape the skewer around the grill based on the flexibility of the wire. I had to be careful when moving them around, as they *do* conduct heat better than wood. I also had to remove the food from the skewer before serving, as a looping wire doesn't quite have the same visual pizazz as individual wooden skewers.I'll definitely be adding more grilled veggies into my routine by using the TeiKis mats. I'm not sure how much I'll use the skewers, but I still like the idea of having them around if needed.Disclosure:Obtained From: RetailerPayment: Free\"]\n",

It looked about the size of a small canvas shopping bag and was no heavier, either. But once opened, it unfolded into a crisp, light, expansive grill cover, which I put to work immediately on my barrel-shaped, iron charcoal grill.The cover fit right over the top with plenty of room to spare, and because it is so light, I had some qualms about how I might fasten it to keep it from blowing away. Fortunately, it has two sets of Velcro closures, one at each end of the cover, which allowed me to tighten its grip on my grill and hold the cover in place. The roominess also gives me enough space to accommodate the attached smoker chimney without compromising the length and therefore, still able to cover both front and back of the grill all the way down to the deck top. The cover looks great and I love the color, texture and lightness. Because it is so roomy, removing it was a breeze as well and the lightweight fabric makes it easy to fold up and store until you are ready to pop it back over the grill. And sure, all it has to do is keep the rain and bugs out, but, it&#8217;s doing that, so as long as it looks nice, there&#8217;s nothing much I can complain about.Amazon requires that I assess this product within 30 days, so I&#8217;m not able to comment on the purported rust proofing capabilities, but since it is a Rustoleum product, I have no reason to doubt the claim. As a matter of fact, with the onset of rust quite noticeable  on my charcoal grill, I have every expectation that this grill cover will prolong the grill&#8217;s serviceable life. At the very least, it looks good, is well made and easily fits over my grill, so I have no reason to give it less than the full five stars.']\n",

By the end of the hot, humid Texas summer, I should have a fairly good idea of how long it will last, because any cover that's able to withstand several months of obnoxious heat will probably last for more than a year.

Plastic covers are useless - they tear easily and rot pretty fast in the sun. The 2 ton canvas one we had last worked ok for covering the grill but it was heavy, got rotten after about 3 years and I think, because it kept the air off the grill, contributed to the rust problem we had.This cover is so light weight that at first I was afraid it would just blow off but, wonder of wonders, they actually put velcro in exactly the right places on the ends to tighten the fabric and hold it in place.

I was apprehensive about the durability of one so lightweight, but since the others have only marginally held up, I was anxious to give this one a try. I like that there&#8217;s a non-toxic barrier to corrosion and UV protection. The light weight makes it easy to put on and remove, and there are Velcro straps to keep it snugged down in windy weather.Time will tell how durable it will be, but I&#8217;m happy with it and the neutral color looks ever so much better on our deck and against the newly painted house.']\n",

First I tried it on the lawn tractor.  It covered everything except the wheels just fine, and stayed in place great.  It just fit, so it wouldn\\'t fit a larger tractor.Next, I tried it on the grill.  This is an average-sized, 50\" wide 3-burner grill.  It fit over the top okay, though it didn\\'t quite cover the base.  It was about 1-2\" too short.  Then I tried fastening the velcro straps on each side just under the side shelves to keep it in place.  On one side they fastened fine, but on the other the slightest pull on one and it came right off.  As a test I tried the other also - it came off with only a little more force, a little less than what it takes to tear a sheet of paper out of a spiral notebook.The picture on the product page doesn\\'t match the one I received.  For one thing, it doesn\\'t show the 2 straps on each side, so maybe they were a last minute change; without them the cover can slide around, and might even blow off in windy conditions, esp. on small to medium grills.  The side without the straps is billowing a bit right now outside in moderate wind.  Also, the seams on mine are completely different.  The fabric looks similar, but mine has heat welding seals all along the bottom edge.I pulled the cover out to one side and measured it; it would just barely fit a 60\" wide grill of average depth and height, though it might be a very tight fit.The material itself seems medium-weight, has heat-welded seems and a cloth feel.

The clamp looked like it would fit a microphone stand and that is what inspired me to undertake a review.When I first received it I could not believe that the on/off marking on the top of the lamp was a real switch. It looked as though it was painted on the casing, but someone forgot the switch. After loading it with batteries a mere touch of the marking switches the light on and off. It's pretty clever actually and one of the reasons why I gave it five stars.The battery compartment requires a small Phillips head screwdriver to access the compartment. It's a pain, but it has a purpose: it keeps the compartment waterproof. I tested that by actually submerging the light in a sink basin filled with water. It remained lit and was no worse from my experiment after I removed it and dried it off. So if you do use this for outdoors grilling and forget to bring it back in, it will probably survive the elements for months.I use mine as a handy flashlight that I can conveniently affix to a mic stand. When I need to illuminate a section of a dimly lit stage, a few turns on the clamp screw releases it and I can use it as a conventional flashlight. It is actually strong enough to be a close-in work light for minor repairs in the dark.

They also work well for holding down a piece of meat while slicing.I haven&#8217;t tried scooping charcoal in or out of the grill, but no doubt they would work well for that. The tines themselves are approximately 1-3/4&#8221; long and the entire &#8220;paw&#8221; is a full 4-1/4&#8221; wide. The tips of the tines are quite sharp and easily stab and hold anything I tried. The plastic is quite solid and I was easily able to grip and work them both in tandem.

I even tried using them as mixers and even though they are shorter than a salad fork and spoon set, they worked quite well.

Every season there seems to be one central character that Dexter must hunt down, amongst various other serial killers and murders that end up getting chopped up on his table.  This season follows Dexter&#8217;s pursuit of the Ice Truck Killer&#8212;a sadistic serial killer that chops bodies into pieces after draining all of their blood.  He&#8217;s named the Ice Truck Killer because it is believed that he drives around in an ice truck before dumping the bodies off.  Great pilot season.  If you have not seen this show, this is definitely one you do not want to miss.',\n",
              " \"This isn't one of those shows or movies about a serial killer who just does it for fun.  Dexter Morgan targets people very specifically and only those whom he believes have crossed a line or violated one of his standards.  For example, Dex would never molest or kill a child, so he kills a man who has done such things to choir boys.  This is not a defense of Dex, just a clarification.What makes him even more complex is that he did not suffer abuse at the hands of his loving foster parents; he maintains a good relationship with his sister, a cop; he works as a forensic examiner for the police; he fakes emotions as best he can with  his girlfriend and her kids; and feels nothing at all, most of the time, unless it's a sense that he must get rid of someone.Michael C. Hall's performance and voiceover work are very strong. He's stretched out further than he could with his character on the late, great Six Feet Under.\",\n",
              " 'If you\\'re reading this you either are 1) a fan of the show 2) want to know more about it to see if it will appeal to you. Michael C. Hall (\"Six Feet Under\") plays Dexter a vigilante serial killer. By day Dexter works as a splatter analyst in the police department using blood patterns to help determine exactly how a crime occurred.We have a true anti-hero as the focus of the series--a serial killer who almost seems to have a conscience because he focuses on dealing out justice (and focusing his urges)to those he feels are evil. His father a police officer instilled a code to help him direct his \"urges\" and distinguish between good and evil.Showtime has attempted to improve the quality of their shows and their DVD releases with some mixed results. I found the image quality to be anything but subpar for a DVD. It\\'s a very good transfer. Is it high definition? No, but this isn\\'t an HD-DVD and the quality for a standard DVD is very good although there are some digital compression issues that crop up occasionally.The one complaint I have is simple--no chapter indexing where you can see specific scenes for each episode. Sure you can skip through it by hitting the next button but it\\'s kind of unusual in this day and age for new shows to NOT have this. The second is minor and others have pointed it out--the menu is a very basic design that looks like it could have been done by an amateur.You also have to reset audio for each disc as you watch it for 5.1 as it automatically defaults to 2.o. To be sure many of these are minor points but they do contribute to the enjoyment of the show if handled well.The special features are an improvement over some previous Showtime series but far from perfect. We get two episodes of the excellent Showtime drama \"Brotherhood\". We also get \"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation\" a very good featurette that focuses on splatter analysis and what it reveals about a murder. It ties in to \"Dexter\" because that\\'s what Dexter does for a living on the show and it also helps him to break a number of cases. We also get a commentary track that I haven\\'t listened to yet as well as an online link to watch two episodes of the new Showtime series \"The Tudors\" and a pdf file with the first two chapters of the new Dexter novel. I suspect that \"The Academy of Blood: A Killer Course\" is along with the DEXTER novel excerpt buried in the DVD-Rom portion of the disc. You won\\'t be able to watch it or access it on a regular DVD player which is just plain sloppy as this isn\\'t indicated on the package.We also get biographies for the actors. While the extras here (including two commentary tracks on the set are very good, the show could have used more commentary tracks and the involvement of star Michael C. Hall on at least one of them. Also, the special features really need to be more clearly indicated as to whether they are DVD accessible, PC accessible and where you might find them on the disc.Minor Plot Spoilers:Dexter\\'s father a police officer recognized early on his son\\'s proclivities and tried to give him moral guidence and boundaries so that he can function in our world but, more importantly, use his \"skills\" to hunt down those that prey on others.Dexter is conflicted--he knows that he\\'s not normal and he also knows he doesn\\'t fit in (he has difficulty with emotions having to fake his way through it). He also recognizes what he is and how his father tried to shape him into something \"better\".When he goes toe-to-toe with the Ice Truck Murderer and tries to track down this nasty serial killer he gets a glimpse into his own soul but also recognizes that unlike his evil doppleganger he can choose his actions and not just act on his instincts.END OF PLOT SPOILERS:Overall, Dexter is a terrific show. The second season has also gotten off to a bold start. The first season used the novel DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER as a starting point. For the second season the writers/producers have chosen to depart from the novels which should make for an interesting move. This is a solid set that could be improved with future seasons.',\n",
              " '\"Dexter\" is built on an intriguing premise: a man with antisocial personality disorder experiences murderous impulses but lives by a code - he can only kill murderers.  Kind of a twisted play on Freud\\'s concept of sublimation.  The series didn\\'t initially appeal to me, but overall I\\'m pleased that I stuck with the first season.  Michael C. Hall plays the titular character, a forensic expert in blood splatter.  He works alongside a group of detectives assigned to some of most brutal Miami murders; one of these cops is Dexter\\'s adopted sister, Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter).  Dexter was adopted as a child by a Miami cop (the now deceased Harry Morgan) who recognized that Dexter was antisocial.  Instead of allowing Dexter to go down the path of juvenile delinquency (and inevitably murder), Harry developed a code for him - you can kill but only under certain circumstances.  Harry also encouraged Dexter to do things to make him seem normal, such as dating, to help him hide his true nature and go undetected.  Most episodes feature Dexter stalking a serial killer, with a season long plot involving Dexter\\'s fascination with the \"Ice Truck Killer.\"The series features excellent writing and direction, which helps make the somewhat unbelievable premise feel realistic.  The acting also is top-notch.  Hall does a nice job of making Dexter charming and likeable (so that we can believe that he can fit in at work and his relationships) while also adding a bit of edge through his lack of true emotion, superficial charm, and violent impulses.  We can sense that evil lurks just below the surface, kept in check only by his adherence to his code.  It\\'s a solid portrayal of an extreme case of antisocial personality disorder, and the series isn\\'t afraid to make its protagonist dark and somewhat frightening.  The supporting cast is also terrific, with C.S. Lee scoring as Vince Masuka, Dexter\\'s lascivious co-worker who is a walking sexual harassment case.  Likewise, Sgt. Doakes (Erik King) helps lighten the mood as the only person who seems to know that Dexter is not the good guy he portrays.  I also enjoy the work of two \"Oz\" veterans - Lauren Velez as Dexter\\'s complicated Lieutenant, and David Zayas as Detective Angel Batista (perhaps Dexter\\'s closest \"friend\").Although I enjoyed the show, there were a few things I disliked about the first season.  Debra\\'s insecurity is highly grating, and the actress gives a twitchy, affected performance.  Dexter\\'s flashbacks to his days with Harry become extremely repetitive and unrealistic after awhile.  The first few episodes were difficult to watch, and Dexter came across as quite brutal; I was ready to give up on the series after these shows, but the character became more \"human\" in subsequent episodes.  Finally, the last two episodes of the season, which focused on the Ice Truck Killer case, were overly melodramatic and lead to a rather unsatisfying ending.  Although I approached the series with some trepidation and found it flawed, there\\'s enough to like about the Season 1 that I plan on watching Season 2 on DVD.',\n",
              " \"This series is absolutely one of the best cop shows I have ever seen.  One reason is because Vick goes beyond what is dictated by the law and this is what a lot of citizens would do if they had the chance.  At first I couldn't decide if he was a good cop or a bad cop but by the end of the series I came to believe that he is just a mix of both.I can not really rate season 5 by it's self because I actually do not see any difference in any of the seasons.  They are every one a spell binding, can't wait till I see the next one kind of a series.  One of the things that make it outstanding is that they don't use an episode as a stand alone show.  There are plots that continue through many episodes and mini plots that get solved in one episode.My wife and I stayed up way past our normal bedtimes many nights because we kept saying... lets watch just one more!\",\n",

Veronica Mars, the movie, is essentially a love letter from the cast & crew to the fans.A long time ago, we used to be friendsBut I haven\\'t thought of you lately at all...It\\'s been roughly ten years since we last saw Veronica, back when she was a teenaged private eye poking her nose in everyone\\'s biz in Neptune, Cali. The movie\\'s opening sequence fills us in on what she\\'s been up to. Veronica is interviewing for a place in a prestigious New York law firm that especializes in dumping frivolous cases before they get to court. (So much for what would\\'ve been the 4th Season premise of her landing in the FBI.) Veronica confides that she got out of Neptune when she was 19, got herself a B.A. in psychology at Stanford, was near the top of her class in Columbia law. Interview over, Veronica hopes for the best.She claims that her amateur sleuthing days are in the rear view and her nosy disposition tamped down. And when her bad boy ex Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is implicated in murder and he calls her, pleading for her help, she assures her current beau that she\\'s only going to provide Logan with lawyery advise. So it\\'s back home for Veronica, a reunion with her ex with the baggage and a dive back into a posh but then scuzzy space redolent of leftover angst and reputations ruined and inner demons outed but never exorcised. That unknown murderer lurking in the midst - because it can\\'t possibly be Logan, right? - almost seems a footnote. Just another day in Neptune.The best bits about the television show get reincarnated. It\\'s still ultimately about the underdog, the perceived loser, putting one over the bullies. Very much intact is that marvelous father-daughter synergy between Kristen Bell and the fantastic Enrico Colantoni. Veronica and Logan\\'s relationship is still... complicated. Veronica still cracks wise. She\\'s still incredibly dogged. There\\'s huge gratification in catching up with a host of familiar faces. Everyone came back! Plus, there\\'s a surprise cameo or three. Okay, if you don\\'t know Veronica Mars from Bruno Mars, you won\\'t get it. But this isn\\'t about luring in the uninitiated. See, you\\'ve caught me in mid-celebration. I\\'m still gobsmacked that there\\'s a Veronica Mars movie, and I think we marshmallows suspected it wasn\\'t gonna make tons of money, but so what? Maybe tomorrow I\\'ll watch this again and then I\\'ll notice flaws. But that\\'s tomorrow. This movie is a collaborative labor of love among the filmmakers, the cast, and the ardent, mobilized fans. For now, I\\'m keeping it on the pedestal.The DVD\\'s bonus stuff:- \"By the Fans: The Making of the Veronica Mars Movie\" - a very cool documentary in which Rob thomas, Kristen Bell and the entire Veronica Mars cast take you from its record-breaking Kickstarter launch to pre-production to the first day on set and beyond! Includes a segment from the backers\\' perspectives as they show up as extras on the set (00:55:36 minutes long)']),\n",

              "'With a pretty cool subterranean monster,Tremors(1990) was a fairly successful creature flick, which spawned three subsequent films.  Tremors the TV series, retains many of the original story elements, as events are mostly centered near the tiny settlement of Perfection, Nevada (Population 12), where the carnivorous sand worms known as &#8220;Graboids&#8221;, continue to threaten those residing in the area.  For those acquainted with the movies, the TV program has a very familiar feel, as Michael Gross resumes the role of Burt Gummer, a heavily armed survivalist type, with a passion for killing the creatures who are responsible for the death of his wife.Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, and Gross were the stars of the original movie, with Gross assuming the lead role in the sequels, as the gun happy Gummer was the ideal character to continue the battle to save Perfection.  With Gross as the producer, the TV series features a stubborn group of settlers, who are determined to stay, in spite of the danger.  Newcomer Tyler Reed (Victor Browne) arrives in Perfection, as the new owner of Desert Jack&#8217;s Graboid Adventure, and is quickly integrated into the community that includes Nancy Sterngood (Marcia Strassman), Rosalita Sanchez (Gladise Jimenez), and storekeeper Jodi Chang (Lela Lee).  Melvin Plugg (Robert Jayne) is a developer looking to buy out the residents, while the charismatic Dean Norris (Breaking Bad, Under the Dome) plays W.D. Twitchell, an official from the Department of the Interior.The stories are pretty creative, with some good action scenes, as the settlers are threatened by several variations of the beast, who are attracted to the heat of the human body.  In addition to head sandworm &#8220;el blanco&#8221;, and other Graboids, there are also &#8220;shriekers&#8221;, two legged creatures, that often attack in groups, and even a flying beast known as an &#8220;ass-blaster&#8221;.  The special effects by Encore Visual Effects, and Greg Nicotero&#8217;s KNB EFX Group, are often impressive, much better than you might expect for a TV program.When originally aired on the Sci Fi Channel, the 13 one hour episodes were broadcast out of order.  The DVD release presents them in the order they were intended to be.  The picture is full screen, with image quality being very good.  If you&#8217;re a fan of the Tremors franchise looking for a little more Graboid action, you will probably enjoy this short lived series, which is currently available at really low price.'"

              "\"Out of all the new comedies that have come out in the last ten years, Sunny is as the top of my list.  You need an affinity for quirky, offbeat humor to enjoy it, not to mention a high tolerance for raw language and sexual humor.  The first season consisted of just seven episodes, but established the core characters and operators of Paddy&#8217;s Pub; owners Dennis, Mac, and Charlie, and waitress/Dennis&#8217;s twin sister Dee.  In Season 2 (ten episodes), Danny Devito comes on board as Frank, Dennis and Dee&#8217;s dad.  The show&#8217;s creators (Rob McElhenney/ Mac; Glenn Howerton/Dennis; and Charlie Day/Charlie) are hilarious as actors, and also as writers.  Every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me.  It&#8217;s one of those great ensemble casts that&#8217;s incredibly balanced in terms of the personalities and comedic nature of each character, resulting in a consistently high level of quality in every episode.  These first two seasons have some of my favorites, including &#8220;Charlie Has Cancer,&#8221; &#8220;Charlie Got Molested,&#8221; &#8220;Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,&#8221; &#8220;Hundred Dollar Baby,&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody&#8217;s Ass.&#8221;  Like most fans of the show, I tend to favor the Charlie-themed episodes, and considering that he&#8217;s the only one so far to get movie roles and a gig hosting SNL, it&#8217;s clear how important he is as part of the cast.  But that&#8217;s not a knock against anyone else.  I can&#8217;t really imagine it continuing if they lost any of the key characters of Dennis, Dee, Mac, and Charlie, and even though Frank wasn't there in the beginning, it would definitley hurt the show to lose him.  As far as current TV comedies go, no one else is doing anything funnier than &#8220;Always Sunny,&#8221; and these first two seasons show it.\""

              "'This light-duty trimmer works well but struggles with heavier weeds.  The standardized interchangeable 18V batteries last just long enough, and the adjustable handle and length make it easy to configure for me or the GF to use with equal ease.  Assembly is easy, and the unit feels solid.I would have liked the lithium-ion model (charges faster, lighter, battery is less toxic than Ni-Cad) but at half-again the price, that wasn\\'t worth the extra cost.I also asked Black&Decker; how the NST2118 differed from the previousNST2018which is also sold on amazon (and well reviewed).  B&D; replied: \"The new NST2118 trimmer has the same key features as the NST2018 other than the guard and the aux handle. The unit is still supplied with (2) 18 volt batteries and one charger. No difference in job performance and run time.\"  So as far as I can tell, no reason to buy the older Ni-Cad model since they both sell for a similar price.I was an early adopter of rechargeable lawn equipment, and this NST2118 replaces my ancient CST2000 (circa mid-late 90s) with 12V Lead-Acid battery.  That old trimmer was much much heavier, with lower RPM, and non-adjustable handle/length.  I hope this new one lasts me just as long.  The new trimmer\\'s much lighter weight, redesigned trigger, and adjustable length and handle are much easier on my arms, although the unit does still transmit vibration up the shaft.I need to use both battery packs to do my normal string-trimming on 1/3 of an acre: around beds, curbs, pavement, edge of house, weeds on driveway.  This works fine for me but those of you with larger properties should look at a different model.Other than power, my only quibbles were imprecise machining on the plastic of the shield (it was hard to wedge into place), and the edging guard not locking into place (it extends to maintain height for edging, but the weight of the trimmer pressing it into the ground causes it to recede back into the unit).So for light duty, this is a great little trimmer that could be more powerful, but the price and features are right.  Those looking for heavier use might do better with one of Black & Decker\\'s 24V or 36V models, or the Lithium-Ion powered models (all more expensive).  Commercial-duty users should stick to gas.For my purposes, this trimmer works very well, and is Recommended.'"

              "'I am a big fan for digitizing documents for archiving. I have been doing so for more than 10 years. On hardware part, I have used several consumer level scanners from Brothers and Canon. On software part, I use PaperPort pro software to control scanners and also for post-scanning document editing purpose. The biggest problem of consumer level scanner is \"SLOW\". I am very happy to try out this i2900, a business class scanner.The i2900 itself does not have big internal memory buffer. The scanned image is saved in the internal memory first and then passed to PC through the USB cable. When the internal memory is filled up, i2900 will pause and wait for its internal memory buffer to be freed up. Once its memory buffer is freed up, it then automatically resumes scanning. So, the overall scanning speed depends on (1) the resolution setting, (2) desktop PC capability and (3) connection speed between PC and the scanner.For scanning with black & white or grey with resolution at 300dpi (or below), the scanner itself is not the speed bottleneck. The PC and connection speed between scanner and PC are the speed bottleneck. For scanning with resolution above 300dpi, then scanner itself can also play a role to impact the overall speed. My PC is a relative new Intel iCore 7 quad-core desktop with 12G memory. The connection between scanner and PC is through the new USB3. If I scan with black & white or grey at 300dpi or below, the scanner can scan hundreds or papers without pausing. And the overall scanning speed is close to the claimed 60 pages per minute. But if I can at 400dpi, from time to time, the scanner does pause. At higher resolution settings (above 400dpi), the slow \"scanning\" part by itself drags down the overall speed.The capability of scanning double side documents \"simultaneously\" is a big time saving. After scanned data is sent from scanner to PC, the software run in the PC will then convert the scanned images to PDF, searchable PDF or JPEG format...etc (per user\\'s selection). Converting to the searchable PDF file is a heavy duty task to the PC, especially with high resolution settings. For 300dpi, my CPU usage is around 40% (a iCore 7 quad-core CPU with 12G ram). For 600dpi setting, my CPU usage is at the 95+%. So, the PC (not the scanner) is the speed bottleneck on this part. Or, you can save the image into non-searchable PDF for faster processing time.I can not comment on the quality of color scanning. This business-class scanner is mainly for scanning \"big amount\" of documents fast with good quality. For my document archiving purpose, I stick to 300dpi with either black & white or grey modes. The black-and-white scanning quality (at 300dpi) is very impressive. Once a while, I do use the \"grey\" mode if the original document has a lot of faded marks. The final file size of the black-and-white with 300dpi resolution is very small. This is very good when I need to email out the scanned documents.During the one month ownership, I have scanned more than 1000 pages of documents, the document sources include regular 8x11 printouts, legal size papers, magazine papers with various paper thickness and slickness,  news paper cut-off with various sizes, receipts with various sizes and various paper thickness, ...etc. To my surprise, I have not run into any paper jam. Also, the paper feeding wheel never double feeds paper (two pages a time) into the scanner.The paper feeding tray can hold 250 pages of documents.That, indeed, does save me quite some work when archiving a big load of documents.Besides the rotary scanner for fast scanning, i2900 also has an additional flatbed scanner for scanning books. The flatbed scanner is very similar to other consumer level flatbed scanner. It scans slow. Not a big deal, as the flatbed scanner is mainly for occasional usage.When not used for a certain time (per user\\'s configuration), i2900 goes into energy saving mode. After being in energy saving mode for a certain time (per user\\'s configuration), it shuts itself off. Both the wake-up time (from the energy saving mode) and power-up time are fast.The provided Smart Touch software is able to control all i2900 scanner functions. So, there is no need to push any button on the scanner. I can also use my PaperPort pro to control the i2900.The package comes with an additional Kodak Capture Desktop software. This software is mainly for setting up batch jobs used by office admin or operators. In office environment, people just need to select the batch job type, then a stack of documents are scanned, indexed, and saved into a pre-defined file type. A video tutorial CD is provided in the package for training how to setup various batch job types.After more than 10 years of experience with the slow consumer level scanners, I am very impressed by the scanning speed and the scanning quality of i2900. This is a very good scanner for small office, or for people with big scanning needs at home.'"
